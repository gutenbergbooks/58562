<p class="p4 center">PREFACE</p>

<hr class="style2"/>

<p>«Music may be hard to understand,
but musicians are men;»
so remarked a friend of mine
when I was first planning
these essays. The sentence
sums up very happily a truth I have constantly
had in mind in writing them. As all
music, no matter what its complexity on the
technical side, is in essence an expression of personal
feeling, and as the qualities of a man's
personality show themselves not only in his
works, but in his acts, his words, his face, his
handwriting and carriage even, it has seemed
natural and fruitful, in these studies, to seek
acquaintance with the musicians through acquaintance
with the men.</p>

<p>But personal expression depends not alone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
on the personality of the artist; it depends also
on the resources of art, which in turn are the
product of a long, slow growth. Accordingly,
if we would understand the individual composers,
we must have a sense of the scheme into
which they fall, the great universal evolution
of which they are but incidents. It is for this
reason that I have tried, in the introductory
essay on The Appreciation of Music, to describe
some of the fundamental principles of the art,
and to sketch in their light the general movement
of musical history, in order to give the
reader a perspective sense, a bird's-eye view of
the great army of artists in which the supreme
masters are but leaders of battalions and regiments.
Without this sense it is impossible truly
to place or justly to estimate any individual.</p>

<p>At the end of the introduction I apply the
principles worked out to determining in a general
way how the half dozen composers to be
studied are related to modern music as a whole.
My result is that although they are practically
contemporary, they are by no means peers in
the scope and significance of their work. If we
arrange them in the order of their influence on
art, which depends upon their power both to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
assimilate previous resources and to add new
ones, we must pass «from Grieg to Brahms.»</p>

<p>The purpose of the last essay in the book,
on The Meaning of Music, will be obvious
enough. Just as the introductory essay tries to
sketch the general musical environment, as determined
by basic principles and developed in
history, in relation to which alone the individuals
discussed can be understood, so the epilogue
seeks to suggest that still larger environment
of human feeling and activity on which
music, like everything else, depends for its vitality.
The first essay considers music as a medium
for men, the last considers life as a medium
for music.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to acknowledge here all
that these studies, particularly the first, owe to the
writings of others. Perhaps the books which
have most influenced my treatment of musical
æsthetics are Dr. George Santayana's «Sense of
Beauty» and Dr. C. Hubert H. Parry's «Evolution
of the Art of Music,» though I have got
much help also from Dr. William James's «Principles
of Psychology,» from Dr. Josiah Royce's
books, from Mr. Edward Carpenter, and of
course from Helmholtz, Gurney, Mr. W. H.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
Hadow, and the other standard writers on musical
theory. In gathering the biographical
material I have had much cordial and skillful
help from Miss Barton, of the Boston Public
Library, for which I here record my thanks.</p>

<p class="center"><big>NOTE TO THE THIRD IMPRESSION</big></p>

<p>Sir Charles Villiers Stanford has pointed
out an error in the story told of Brahms
on page 178. It was not the Cambridge
University authorities who invited Brahms
to write a new work, but the managers of
the Leeds Festivals, who, after long neglect
of his already printed compositions, asked
him, in 1887, to write them a new one;
whereupon he returned the answer described.</p>

INTRODUCTION<br />
THE APPRECIATION OF MUSIC</p>
<hr class="style2"/>

<p>However interesting may be the
study of an art through the personalities
of the artists who have
produced it, and such study, since
art is a mode of human expression,
is indeed essential, it must be supplemented
by at least some general knowledge of the long
continuous evolution in which the work of the
most brilliant individual is but a moment, a
phase. The quality of a man's work in art, and
especially, as will be seen in a moment, in music,
depends not alone on the depth of his character
and the force of his talent, but also largely on the
technical resources he owes to others, on the
means for expressing himself that he finds ready
to his hand. Whatever his personal powers or
limitations, the value of his work will be determined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
not more by these than by the helps
and hindrances of his artistic inheritance.</p>

<p>The great edifice of art, in fact, is like those
Gothic cathedrals on which generations of men
successively labored; thousands of common
workmen hewed their foundation stones; finer
minds, architects, smiths, brass founders, glass
makers and sculptors, wrought and decorated
the superstructures; and the work of each,
whatever his personal skill and devotion, was
valuable only because it built upon and added
to that of all the rest. The soaring spires are
firmly based on blocks of stone ploddingly adjusted;
the windows, often of such a perfect
beauty that they seem created rather than constructed,
had nevertheless to be built up bit by
bit; and all the marvelous organism of pillars,
arches and buttresses is so delicately solid, so
precariously stable, that had one stress been miscalculated,
one joint inaccurately made, the
whole would collapse. So it is with the edifice
of art, and particularly with that of music, which
depends for its very material on the labors of
musicians. Pigments, clay, marble, the materials
of the plastic arts, exist already in the world;
but the whole ladder of fixed tones on which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
music is built is the product of man's æsthetic
sense, and had to be created slowly and laboriously
by many generations of men. The successions
of chords which every banjo player
strums in his accompaniments were the subject
of long trial by the mediæval composers. The
hymn tune that any boy can write is modeled
on a symmetrical scheme of phrases developed
by countless experimenters. It took men centuries
to select and arrange the eight tones of
the ordinary scale, and centuries more to learn
how to combine them in chords. And the most
eloquent modern works depend on this long
evolution of resources just as inevitably as the
Gothic spire rests on the hewn stones so carefully
laid. In the art, as in the cathedral, the
seen rests upon the unseen, the beautiful upon
the solid, the complex upon the simple, the new
upon the old. The product of a thousand artists,
music is as dependent on each as the coral
reef on the tiny indispensable body of each insect;
and on the other hand the individual
musician, whatever his ability, is great only as
he uses the equipment his fellows have prepared&mdash;«the
greatest is the most indebted man.»</p>

<p>If, then, we would justly value the half dozen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
composers who have done most for music in our
day, we must add to our understanding of them
as persons a knowledge of the general development
in which they play a part; we must gain
some sense of that great process of musical
growth from which they inherit their resources,
to which they make their various contributions,
and in relation to which alone they can be fairly
compared and appreciated. After examining
the general course of musical history, ascertaining
some fundamental principles, and applying
these principles to our special judgments, we
shall be able to perceive the greatest musicians
of our day in their relations, and to get a perspective
view of modern music in which they
shall take their proper places.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>If we wish to get an idea of primeval music,
to see from what impulses it took rise, we have
only to study the musical activities of children
and savages, in whom we have primeval man
made contemporary, the remote past brought
conveniently into the present to be observed.
When we make such a study we find that both
children and savages express their feelings by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
gestures and cries, that under the sway of emotion
they either dance or sing. To them quiet,
silent feeling is impossible. Are they joyful,
they leap and laugh; are they angry, they strike
and shout; are they sad, they rock and moan.
Moreover, we can discriminate the kinds of feeling
that are expressed by these cries and gestures.
Roughly speaking, bodily movement is the natural
outlet of active vitality, of the joy of life
and the lust of living, while it is the more contemplative
emotions&mdash;love, grief, reverie, devotion&mdash;that
find vocal utterance. The war-dances
and revels of savages, accompanied by
drum and tomtom, are gesticulatory; their love-songs
and ululations over the dead are vocal.
In the same way children in their moments of
enthusiasm are wont to march about shouting
and stamping in time, all their limbs galvanized
with nervous force; and it is when the wave of
energy has passed and they sit on the floor engrossed
in blocks or dolls that they sing to themselves
their curious undulating chants. Even in
ourselves we can observe the same tendencies,
checked though they be by counter-impulses in
our more complex temperaments: when we are
gay we walk briskly, clicking our heels in time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
and perhaps whistling a catch; in our dreamier
hours we are quiet, or merely hum a tune under
our breath. Thus through all human nature
runs the tendency to vent feeling, active
and contemplative, in those bodily movements
and vocal utterances which underlie the two
great generators of music, dance and song.</p>

<p>Such activities, however, are by no means as
yet dance and song. At first they are no more
than mere reflex actions, as spontaneous and
unthinking as the «Ow» of the man who stubs
his toe. The emotion is felt, and out comes
the gesture or cry; that is all. It is the organism's
way of letting off steam. It is not expression,
not being prompted by a desire to communicate
the feeling, but merely by the impulse
to be unburdened of it. Before there can be
true expression or communication, there must
be two more links added to the chain of which
these automatic activities are only the first.
The second link is imitation. According to a
theory widely exploited in recent years, we tend
to imitate whatever we see another do. With
children the tendency is so strong that a large
part of their time and energy is devoted to
elaborate impersonation and make-believe, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the entire basis of their education is acquired
through this directly assimilative faculty. In
adults it is less active, but every sensitive person
knows how difficult it is not to imitate foreign
accents, stammering, and other petty mannerisms,
and few are so callous that they can withstand
the infection of strong stimuli like the
gestures and cries of emotion. The wailing
baby in the street car, who moves all the other
babies within hearing to wail also (if they be not
already at it independently); the dog baying
the moon until all within earshot join in the
serenade; the negro at the camp-meeting clapping
his hands until the whole company is in a
rhythmic ecstasy&mdash;these are examples of the
contagion of cries and gestures. Bearing them
in mind, it is easy to see that the vocal or bodily
acts which in the first place are mere reflexes
of feeling, performed with no thought
of expression, but only for personal easement,
will generally, nevertheless, prompt similar acts
in others. The performances of the individual
will not end with himself; thanks to the instinct
of imitation, they will be very widely copied.</p>

<p>But now&mdash;and this is the third link of the
chain&mdash;bodily acts set up mental states, and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
man cannot gesticulate or vocalize without feeling
the emotions of which his actions are, as we
say, expressive. «We feel sorry because we
cry,» writes Professor William James in his
brilliant, paradoxical way, «angry because we
strike, afraid because we tremble;» and whether
or not we agree with his extreme view that
the mental state is entirely a reverberation of
bodily disturbances, we cannot but realize that
in all these cases executing the expression tends
to give us the feeling. He who persistently
smiles will end by being cheerful, and a moderate
amount of sighing or groaning will make
any one melancholy. Above all, the imitation
of vocal movements, such as we all go through
at least incipiently when we hear melody, and
the «keeping time» that strong dance-music
so irresistibly prompts&mdash;these actions very
noticeably set up in us their appropriate states
of feeling. We not only imitate the lip motions
and throat contractions of a persuasive
speaker or singer, but doing so fills us with the
emotion that prompts his utterance. Tired soldiers
not only step out to a potently rhythmical
tune&mdash;that is, they not only imitate the beat&mdash;but
they actually feel less weary, more energetic,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
so long as the stimulus lasts. Once a bodily
activity is set up, no matter how, it arouses the
mental state proper to it; in a word, expression
generates emotion.</p>

<p>Obviously, then, if in the first place the natural
outlets of emotional excitement are bodily
motions and vocal sounds, if in the second
place the observation of such motions and
sounds arouses the impulse to imitate them,
and if finally this imitation produces again in
the imitator the states of mind which first set the
whole process going, then these motions and
sounds, these inchoate germs of dance and song,
possess an enormous latent power of expression,
and need only to be systematized to become a
wonderfully eloquent language. Such a language,
in fact, is music.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>At this point, however, it is important not
to go too fast. These crude gestures and cries
by which primeval man expressed his feelings,
though they were the germs out of which music
grew, were as yet no more music, which is not
only expressive sound, but formed, articulate
sound, than an infant's cooings are speech. So
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
far they were mere ebullitions, purposeless and
formless; before they could become communicative
they must become definite, they must
take on some organic structure. Now gestures,
bodily movements, are very easily grouped together
by means of accent. Every walker knows
that it is difficult not to emphasize alternate
steps, grouping the unaccented with the accented
into a cluster of two. Every waltzer makes a
similar grouping of three steps, one accented,
the other two subordinate. Some such system
of grouping is instinctively adopted whenever
we have a series of impressions regularly recurring
in time. Let the reader, listening to
the ticking of a watch, note how impossible it
is to attend to each tick by itself. He will
inevitably group them in twos; the accent may
come on the first or on the last of the group, but
he cannot hear them as exactly equal, any more
than in walking he can put exactly equal stress
on each step. It was this tendency of the mind
to group its impressions on a basis of equal time
measurements and unequal accents that led at
the dawn of musical history to meter or rhythm,
which is as persistent in music as it is in poetry.
Metrical form was the natural means of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
giving definition to bodily movements, and as
soon as it was developed enough to produce
regular, easily imitated steps out of the chaotic
gestures of naïve feeling, Dance was born.</p>

<p>At first, of course, metrical form was stumbled
upon blindly. Having two arms and two
legs, men naturally moved with a symmetry
that gradually impressed their minds; obliged
by the facts of anatomy to group their motions
in twos, they soon took the hint, and beat their
drums or struck their cymbals accordingly.
The primeval dance was doubtless the march.
But soon they began to carry out the principle
they had thus chanced upon, and despite anatomy
devised the group of three. The existence
of triple meter is all the proof needed that
metrical form is essentially a process of intelligence,
not a physical fatality; men grouped
their steps or leaps or drum-taps in twos or in
threes because such groups were easy to make,
to imitate, and to remember. And once perceived,
no matter how, such groupings tended
to cling, to perpetuate themselves. For they
were definite, memorable forms, and they survived
all haphazard gestures and vague motions
by virtue of the law that what is adapted to its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
environment will live longer than what is not.
In this case the environment was the human
mind; and the definite organisms, the metrical
forms, survived and developed because the mind
could remember them, while all the vague gestures
out of which they grew shared the fate
of what is indefinite, accidental, inorganic.
Thus Dance, which was gesticulation systematized
by metrical form, emerged and grew in the
human mind, like an animal in a congenial habitat.</p>

<p>For a long while the metrical forms that men
could perceive and remember were most rudimentary.
Probably it took them centuries to
grasp the simple group of three, the basis of
such accent-schemes as the waltz and the mazurka.
Even to-day, psychologists agree, we
are unable to grasp a group of seven, and we
perceive larger groups than three only as compounded
of the elementary twos and threes.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
But gradually men learned to recombine their
groups in still larger forms, of which the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>groups constituted the elements. Just as in
chemistry the basic elements like oxygen and
hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon, can combine
only in a few simple ways, but the compound
molecules thus produced can recombine into
the myriad substances of organic chemistry, the
sugars and starches and all the rest, so the simple
dual and triple measures of music can be
built into an infinite variety of figures and
phrases. In early dance and folk-song a more
and more complex metrical plan thus slowly
developed. Two or more of the simple groups
of beats, called measures, were combined into
a larger group, a recognizable figure or motif;
then again motifs were combined into still
larger phrases; and finally, as the musical medium
became more definite, plastic and various,
phrases were combined in many different types
of design, into complete «tunes.» In all these
regroupings, the wonderful variety of which is
one of the most precious resources of modern
music, the fundamental procedure was the same&mdash;elements
alike in duration, but different in
accent or significance, were made to cohere in
a group or form. Just as in verse the feet, or
elementary metrical forms whose elements are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
single syllables of equal duration but unequal
stress, are combined into lines, and later these
lines into stanzas, so in music measures are
combined in figures, and figures built up into
phrases, and phrases into tunes. And as the
diversity of the possible forms becomes greater
and greater as we advance from foot to stanza,
there being few forms of feet but many of
stanza, so metrical form in music becomes more
and more complex as it evolves, and though
all music must be built out of dual or triple
measures, it may be built into tunes of an infinite
variety of pattern. Each new complexity,
however, must be intelligible; it cannot be introduced
until men have mastered the simpler
groups out of which it is compounded. Beethoven's
wondrously intricate texture, Brahms's
soaring phrases, would be meaningless to us
had we not inherited from thousands of ancestors
a sense of the system of regular accents
and duration on which their complexities are
superposed. From the days, ages ago, when
savages first beat a drum in simple march
rhythm, up to to-day, when Brahms builds up
his extraordinarily intricate fabrics, with their
elaborate prosody, their «augmentation,» and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
«diminution,» and «shifted rhythm,» the evolution
of metrical form has been single and continuous;
each advance has been built on previous
achievements. There are no dropped
stitches in this kind of knitting.</p>

<p>Metrical form, however, is not the only sort
of form by which sounds can be combined. It
is the natural organizing agent of Dance, which,
as we have seen, develops out of the movements
expressive of men's active impulses; but human
nature has also its contemplative side, and this,
expressing itself in vocal utterance, undergoes
another sort of development and results
in Song. What, then, are the means by which
Song is defined, by which vocal sounds are organized
into intelligible and memorable forms?
Before we answer this question it will be well to
consider for a moment a more general one.
What, in general, is a form?</p>

<p>We shall be helped to define a form in general
by looking back to the metrical forms we have just
been studying. These, we have seen, are groups
or clusters of impressions, held together by some
similarity, yet also differentiated by some contrast.
The two or three beats of the measure-group
are similar in duration, yet different in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
accent. And without both the similarity and
the difference, the unity and the variety, they
would not be a group. Without similarity they
would be a haphazard collection, a chaos; without
difference they would all fuse together in
one indistinguishable mass. In other words,
they exemplify a general fact about forms&mdash;namely,
that the elements must be alike enough
to be associated, and yet different enough to be
discriminated. If we cannot associate them we
cannot feel them as a group; they will not cohere.
If, on the other hand, we cannot discriminate
them, then do they equally fail to
make up a form; they simply mingle together
into a homogeneous lump. The organs of an
organism must be, then, related, yet different;
the elements of a form must be both similar and
dissimilar. Unless they are both we cannot
perceive them as linked, yet distinct. Bearing
this general fact about forms in mind, we may
investigate the kinds of form that underlie
Song.</p>

<p>Probably every one who has listened to the
whistling of factories in a large city at noon has
had the curious experience of suddenly hearing
amid the meaningless din a pair of tones that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
mysteriously mate and merge. The other tones
seem entirely accidental; they have no relation
to each other, and give one merely a sense of
vague annoyance. But these two form an intelligible
group; we are able to grasp them together,
and we take an indescribable pleasure in
thus feeling them as parts of one whole. Here
is an instance of another sort of musical form
than the metrical, a sort that we may call harmonic.
Here the grouping takes place on a
platform not of time, but of pitch; the two elements
of the group have no metrical relations,
but in pitch they are somehow related. Now
this sort of pitch relationship has played a vital
part in music, a part hardly secondary to that of
time relationship; so that an understanding of
it is important enough to delay us here a moment
with some rather dry technical facts on
which it depends.</p>

<p>Ordinary musical tones, the notes of the
voice, the violin, and the piano, for example,
simple as they sound, are, like ordinary white
light, rather complex compounds of many simple
elements. There are in them seven or eight
constituent or «partial» tones, quite distinctly
audible to the trained ear or to the untrained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
ear armed with suitable instruments; and these
partial tones, produced by vibrations in the
sound-emitting body whose rates are regularly
related, bear a certain fixed relation to each
other, like the spectrum-colors that compose
white light. Not only this, but each partial
tone arouses its own proper sensation in the ear
by stimulating there one of the minute filaments
called the cords of Corti, each of which vibrates
sympathetically to a tone of given pitch
and to no other. Now we are to imagine that
when an ordinary musical tone is sounded, seven
or eight of these little cords immediately
start a-tremble, and send to the brain their messages,
which combine there into the composite
impression we name «a tone.» If now another
tone is sounded, one which starts into motion
another set of filaments, and if furthermore
there is one filament now set in motion that was
also excited by the first compound tone&mdash;if, in
other words, the two tones happen to have a
partial tone in common, which in both instances
excites the same filament in the ear, then we
shall have a sense of close relationship between
them; they will make together a harmonic
group or form. This, as a matter of fact, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
what happens with any two tones that form
what is called a consonant interval with each
other, an «octave,» a «fifth,» or a «fourth.»
If tones X and Y, for instance, are an octave
apart, the second partial tone of X will be identical
with the first of Y; if they are a fifth apart,
the third partial tone of X will be identical with
the second of Y; if they are a fourth apart, the
fourth partial tone of X will correspond with the
third of Y. It is obvious, then, that all these
intervals will give us the sense of harmonic form;
for they provide all the necessary conditions of
a form, having enough in common to be associated
by our minds, and enough not in common
(their dissimilar partial tones) to be distinguished.
When the partial tone in common
is so high, and therefore so weak, that it impresses
us but slightly, we shall have little or
no sense of their being related; such is the case
in the so-called imperfect consonances and the
dissonances. When, on the other hand, all the
most prominent partial tones of one exist in the
other, they will fuse into one impression in our
minds, losing the characteristic of form entirely,
as is the case to some extent with the octave
and entirely with the unison. But when, as in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the case of fifths and fourths, there are both a
distinctly audible partial tone in common and
others not in common, then we shall have true
harmonic forms.</p>

<p>So much technical detail will be forgiven by
the reader who can at all realize how profoundly
the entire history of music has been affected
by these acoustic and physiological facts. We
have already seen how folk-music slowly
wrought out the complex metrical forms based
upon time grouping. In the same way, ecclesiastical
music wrought out, slowly and laboriously,
the harmonic and melodic forms that
were based upon pitch-grouping. For a long
time vocal utterance was defined only by certain
simple intervals like the fall of the fourth,
which formed the cadences of Greek dramatic
recitation and of mediæval Christian intoning.
Gradually ornamental notes were introduced as
approaches to the final note; these were varied
in pitch, and new ones added, until finally there
resulted the ancient modes, precursors of our
scale. Then, when two melodies began to be
sung at once, the intervals of the octave, fifth,
and fourth were again called into requisition,
and made the bases of primitive harmony. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the old Organum of the Middle Ages, two
voices, a fifth apart, gave the same melody,
just as with the Greeks, in the process called
«magadising,» two voices sang the same tune,
an octave apart. So, step by step, pitch relations
were perceived and utilized. In all stages
of the long progress, whether the interval
chosen was the octave or the fifth or the fourth,
and whether the tones were sounded in succession
as a melodic step or simultaneously as a
chord, the guiding principle was the same;
tones were grouped together which had pitch-form,
which had partial tones in common and
others not in common. A harmonic form, like
a metrical form, was always a cluster of tones
that could be both associated and distinguished.</p>

<p>It was a long time before these two means of
organizing sound were used in combination.
Until the seventeenth century metrical form
was chiefly used, quite naturally, to define the
gesticulatory part of musical material, the product
of active emotion, while harmonic form
gave coherence to the vocal part, the product of
contemplative or religious emotion. Primitive
dance either neglected pitch relationship entirely,
as in that kind of savage music which uses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
only drums, tomtoms, clappers and such percussive
instruments, or used only the simplest
intervals like the fall of the fourth or the rise of
the fifth. And in ecclesiastical Song, all through
the Middle Ages, metrical regularity was not
only not sought for&mdash;it was avoided. Even in
the highly artistic song of the great choral epoch
which culminated in Palestrina there was no
rhythm. Phraseology depended entirely on
the words. Composers avoided anything like
an appearance of even sections, in sharp demarcation,
balancing each other, such as we now
demand. They liked rather to have their melodies
cross and interlace like the strands in a
basket, making a texture solid but inorganic.
To them coherence was a matter merely of
the individual voices; music held together
like a rope rather than like a crystal. Indeed,
any deeper harmonic unity was not
feasible until they had gained more experience
in tone relationship. But eventually the
secular composers of the last half of the
seventeenth century, among whom Arcangelo
Corelli is a typical figure, learned to utilize both
kinds of form, making them supplement and
reinforce each other in all sorts of interesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
and unexpected ways. With Corelli, pure
music emerges as an independent art, beautiful
as sculpture and promising new powers of expression.
By his successors this new promise
was realized with surprising rapidity. Constantly
growing more independent of extraneous
aids, developing, thanks to the fruitful
interaction of metrical and harmonic grouping,
an unprecedented richness and variety, music
became in the hands of Bach and Beethoven a
strong, flexible and efficient fabric, adapted to
all phases of expression and capable of forming
the most complex and self-sufficient structures.
Evolved from the crude gestures and cries of
naïve feeling by a never-ceasing, ever-widening
exertion of man's intelligence, absolute music
has become in some respects the most eloquent
and penetrative of the arts.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Form in music, however, notwithstanding
its origin as a means of defining those emotional
expressions which without it would have
remained vague, unimitable, and immemorable,
is much more than a means of definition. At
first practiced as a means to an end, it soon became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
an end in itself. For the perception of
relations, the mental activity which groups impressions,
is not merely useful; it is profoundly,
indescribably delightful. Calling the mind into
activity just as sensation calls the senses, it is a
far deeper source of pleasure than sensation can
ever be, because the mind far exceeds the
senses in the subtlety, variety and independence
of its action. When, therefore, the primitive
musicians first made their syntheses of gestures
and cries they discovered a novel pleasure, altogether
more delicious than the crude joys of
sensation and expression. Before they made
such syntheses they had merely enjoyed the
sweetness of tones, and taken satisfaction in expressing
their feelings; but when once they
learned to group their expressive tones together,
to feel the subtle bonds which bound them into
clear and salient unity, then they felt a joy altogether
new and on a higher plane, they felt
true æsthetic delight. Here was not merely a
passive, or at most an automatic process; here
was a truly creative activity, a conscious and free
manipulation of materials. Mere hearing, however
delicious, mere expression, however grateful,
could not give this sense of mastery, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
comprehension, of insight. Beauty alone,
beauty depending on consciously made comparisons
and contrasts, can give the highest æsthetic
delight, the delight in form. And so, like
painters who, using form at first to define their
material, come quickly to a realization of its inherent
value, and finally, if they be true artists,
value its pure beauties of line and balance and
composition more highly than any mere richness
of color or of expression, musicians, in the
degree of their true musicianship, came to prize
the intrinsic beauty of music above all its other
qualities.</p>

<p>Sometimes, doubtless, they carried their devotion
too far. In certain periods and individuals
the love of formal beauty has entirely
eclipsed pleasure in expression. Unable to attend
at once to expression and to beauty, many
composers, and in some periods all, have devoted
their entire energy to the quest for formal
perfection. Thus in the work of the Netherland
masters of early counterpoint, in some of
Bach's ingenious weavings, and in much of the
music of Haydn and his contemporaries, the
search for purely plastic qualities goes on with
little thought of the original emotional burden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
of the material that is being formulated. To
such men form was much more than a means
of defining expression; it was an end in itself,
and an end worth a lifetime of painstaking, devoted
effort.</p>

<p>And yet, justifiable as their feeling was, indispensable
as their labors were to that development
without which the expressive power of
music would itself have remained rudimentary,
it is not to their view, but to a more universal
one, that we must look to find a rounded theory
of expression and form. If it be a mistake to
neglect the latter for the former, as they well
saw, it is equally a mistake to prize form with
too exclusive an enthusiasm. For beauty is
itself one of the most potent means of expression.
Our minds are not made up of
hermetic compartments, but are so permeable,
so conductive, that an eloquent thing is
made more eloquent by being also beautiful.
The impression of beauty reverberates endlessly,
intensifying all that is associated with
it. The general atmosphere transfigures every
feature. If the whole is fair, no detail will
be entirely without its appeal to our kindled
imaginations, but if the whole is formless, no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
single phrase, however impassioned, can affect
us very deeply. The truth is, then, that form
and expression in music are as essential to each
other as objects and light in the world of vision.
No radiance of illumination will satisfy the eye
if there is nothing to see, and, on the other
hand, the loveliest things will give little pleasure
in the dark. To be beautiful they must
be suffused in light. Similarly the phrases of
music, to be truly moving, must be suffused in
beauty. The greatest masters clearly realized
this. Bach in his masterpieces, Beethoven
nearly always, and Brahms in his inspired
hours, acted on the principle that the two elements
must exist side by side, subtly and potently
reacting upon each other. Their practice,
indeed, unanimously confirms the theory of
musical effect which has now been briefly
sketched, and which may be more briefly summarized
before we pass on to deduce from it some
general canons of appreciation and criticism.</p>

<p>Music, we have seen, originates in the spontaneous
gestures and cries made by primitive
man under the sway of emotion, imitated by
observers, and arousing in them the same feelings.
As intelligence dawns, men see that this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
triple process of spontaneous action, imitation
and reduplicated feeling affords a basis for a
language of emotion, a language that needs,
however, to be somehow defined and articulated.
Articulation gradually follows by means of the
grouping in time which develops the gestures of
active feeling into Dance, and the grouping in
pitch which develops the utterances of contemplative
feeling into Song. Eventually the
two modes of grouping are combined, and
music becomes an independent art. Meanwhile,
the forms at first adopted for the sake of
mere definition become the basis of a new and
deeper delight, æsthetic beauty, which is sought
for both as ancillary to expression and for itself
alone. Finally, beauty of form reacts potently on
eloquence of expression, and the most universal
composers, recognizing the interdependence of
the two elements, produce the highest type of pure
music, music in which beauty is based upon expression
and expression transfigured by beauty.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The principles we now have before us, interesting
as they are in themselves, must finally
vindicate their worth by helping us to form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
sound opinions of musical tendencies and of individual
composers; they must provide a corrective
for the whims and freaks of prejudice,
and a basis for that intelligent and systematic
criticism which takes account both of a man's
qualities and of his defects before assigning him
his place in the general artistic movement.
With them in mind, we should be able to avoid
the current one-sided and partial views, and also
to attain that positive insight into the nature of
music which alone can give our opinions sanity,
liberality and perspective.</p>

<p>In the first place, then, it will be well to turn
their light on certain dangerous half-truths,
which, constantly cropping up in musical opinions,
are hardly less misleading than complete
fallacies. The two most persistent and mischievous
of such half-truths are those which
neglect one aspect of the dual nature of music,
which ignore expression or repudiate form. Of
the first, the half-truth so frequently formulated
in the phrase, «Music is a kind of audible
mathematics,» it is not necessary to say much.
Those dryly ingenious persons who rejoice in a
fugue of Bach much as they enjoy an intricate
problem in calculus, failing to perceive the warm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
human heart that animates the skeleton, form a
minority which gets little attention from the
mass of music-lovers. The half-truth which
neglects expression will not, in the nature of
things, ever gain a large following. Far more
dangerous is the opposite fallacy, which, repudiating
form, asserts that expression is all, that
«music is the language of the emotions.» This
phrase, without any qualifications, is the creed
of the sentimentalists. Their ranks assemble
all varieties of rhapsodical, ill-balanced temperaments,
from the young girl who «dotes on
Wagner» to the old lady with curls who thinks
that «music leads us up to the higher life.»
The sentimentalists sin, perhaps, not so much
by commission as by omission. So far as they
are able they appreciate music, for they
feel it emotionally, and, as we have seen, half
its reason for being is its appeal to the emotions.
But they fail to realize that it must be beautiful
as well as moving, that all its lineaments of
expression must be held in orderly relation with
a larger integral beauty of form. They fancy
that form, which in reality enhances expression,
is somehow at odds with it, that the mind and
the feelings are natural enemies. Satisfied with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
thrills and tremors, they do not ask, in their
music, for meaning and order. They fancy
that to listen heedfully, attentively, analytically,
is somehow to pull out the petals of art and
strew them in the dust. Analysis is a desecrating
process. You should not focus your ears,
make the image clear; you should swoon in a
delicious haze of sensation and suggestion. But
one can analyze without dissecting; one can recognize
that a flower has petals without pulling
them out; and indeed it is hard to imagine any
one appreciating the true loveliness of a flower,
its formed, articulated beauty, without such recognition.
So in music, the true lover of melody
will be in no danger of confusing Beethoven's
Hymn of Joy with Schumann's <cite>Warum</cite> because
of the trance of nebulous feeling into which they
throw him. He will pay them the tribute of
listening to them attentively, of noting the various
charms of their phraseology and expression
as he would note the difference of meter and effect
between a sonnet of Shakespeare and a song
of Burns. Music is not poorer, but richer, for its
marvelous intricacies of structure, and the sentimentality
which hates clear definition is not high
sentiment, but misconception or insensibility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a suggestive fact, however, that the sentimental
attitude is found among us, not only in
music, but everywhere. It is the tendency of
the day to confuse acquiring with assimilating,
to fancy that wealth of experience is better than
self-mastery and intelligent possession. Heedlessness
is our besetting sin. We skim books,
«do» picture galleries, talk at the opera, interrupt
in conversation, and gobble our food.
Metaphorically, as well as actually, we swallow
more than we can digest, imagining that if we
only subject ourselves to enough impressions
we shall become connoisseurs. We value quantity
rather than quality, in everything from
bric-à-brac to education; and it is quite to be
expected that we should reckon the value of
music by the number of shivers it can give us.
But we are nevertheless capable of a wiser attitude.
We have it in us to learn that feelings
are of no use until they are related to the central
personality, that impressibility is not yet
dignity, that to be informed is not necessarily
to be educated&mdash;that, in a word, possession of
any sort is not an external fact, but an inward
control. We may take a facile interest in the
sentimentalists and the enthusiasts&mdash;the people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
with «temperament»&mdash;but at heart we know
that those passions are deepest which are most
firmly dominated by will, that he is freest who
obeys the highest law, and that «temperament»
is after all less vital than character. We really
prefer organization to coruscation. And so in
music we are capable of learning, and knowledge
of the principles of musical effect can
help us to learn, that the balance and proportion
and symmetry of the whole is far more
essential than any poignancy, however great, in
the parts. He best appreciates music who
brings to it all of his human powers, who understands
it intellectually as well as feels it
emotionally.</p>

<p>In these and other ways the principles of
musical effect afford touchstones for the detection
of prevalent but erroneous views&mdash;views
which contain their element of truth, but are
still fallacious because partial. But the same
principles are also capable of yielding more
positive and detailed insight into the nature of
musical appreciation. They illuminate, for example,
that perplexing problem of expression&mdash;why
it is that from the same piece of music one
person gets so much more than another. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
fact is familiar to every one. Every one knows
that of two persons equally sensitive to music
on the sensuous and formal side, of good «ear,»
and familiar with the effects of harmony, melody
and rhythm, one will get far deeper meanings,
will be far more elated and inspired, than
the other. How can this be? Our theory of
expression gives the clew. We have seen that
bodily states set up by imitation are the basis
of musical emotions. Hearing is always a sort
of ideal performing. In listening to a melody
we always feebly contract our throat muscles as
if to sing, and the perception of rhythm is
always accompanied by an incipient «keeping
time.» These bodily acts, however faintly
realized, set up their appropriate feelings, the
feelings we associate with their actual performance.
But now it should be noted that the
richness, quality, and significance of these feelings
will depend in the case of each man on his
particular associations&mdash;that is to say, on his
entire personal character. Evoked by similar
bodily states, the mental emotions will be always
as dissimilar as the men who feel them.
«We cannot conceive,» says Thoreau, «of a
greater difference than that between the life of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
one man and that of another.» He might
truly have added that we cannot conceive of a
greater difference than that between the feelings
of one man and those of another in hearing
the same piece of music, which excites in both
the same tremors and thrills, but vistas of
thought how utterly unlike! Musical appreciation
is thus subject to the same variations
which make the ordinary experiences of men
so diverse. The prophet on fire with righteous
indignation and the common scold undergo in
anger the same suffusion of blood, the same
boiling up of the organs; yet how different in
dignity and value are their sentiments! And
music, by setting up a certain sympathetic turmoil
in the organs, will plunge one man into a
selfish opium-dream and will fill another with
the rarest, most magnanimous aspirations. It
follows as a practical corollary that he who
would get from music the best it has to offer
must cultivate the best in himself. No fine
sensibility in him, no large heroism, no generosity
or dignity or profundity of character
will be without its quiet, far-reaching effect on
his appreciation of music.</p>

<p>If expression depends thus in part upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
moral and temperamental qualities of the listener,
form in equal measure depends upon his
mental alertness. «Form,» says Dr. Santayana,
«does not appeal to the inattentive; they
get from objects only a vague sensation which
may in them awaken extrinsic associations;
they do not stop to survey the parts or to appreciate
their relation, and consequently are insensible
to the various charms of various unifications;
they can find in objects only the value
of material or of function, not that of form.»
This is unfortunately the case with many who
consider themselves «musical»; they enjoy
sweetness of sound and the rather vague emotion
music arouses in them, but get no clear
sense of its deeper architectural beauty. Like
Charles Lamb, they are «sentimentally disposed
to harmony, but organically incapable of a
tune.» But a thoroughgoing love of music, as
will be clear enough by now, must include an
appreciation of all its aspects; and since beauty
of form is not only delightful in itself, but is a
potent means of expression as well, insensibility
to it involves the loss of much of what is most
precious in music. It is necessary, then, to train
the attention, to listen accurately as well as sympathetically,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
to grasp the thematic phrases as
they occur, to remember them when they recur,
and to follow them through all their transformations.
We should think that man but
slightly appreciative of poetry who, after hearing
a play of Shakespeare, should say that the
words seemed to him mellifluous and that many
passages moved him, but that he had not the
slightest idea what it was all about. Yet how
many of us, after hearing a Beethoven symphony,
have the slightest definite idea what it is about?
If we would get more than transient, profitless
titillation from music, we must cultivate our attention,
learning, to borrow a phrase from optics,
«to make the image sharp.» As we progress in
that faculty we shall constantly see new beauties,
which in turn will constantly react to deepen expression;
and if we are so fortunate as to have also
a nature sensitive, tender, and earnest, fitted to
feel the best kind of emotion that can be aroused
by sound, we may hope to gain eventually an accurate,
intelligent, and deep appreciation of music.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>It remains, now that we have traced the
bearing of our general principles on musical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
taste, to point out briefly how they afford also
criteria for judging composers themselves, and
how, thus judged, the six composers we are to
study fall into perspective. Our principles, in a
word, will now enable us to supplement our later
studies of these composers in isolation with a
somewhat rough but still helpful sense of their
interrelationship. We must relate them to the
general evolution of which they are phases; see
how they differ in the power to assimilate the
work of their predecessors, to avail themselves
of all the resources, expressive and formal, of
their art, and to develop new resources for those
who succeed them. It is hardly necessary to
insist on the value of some such basis of comparison.
Without it we should be like a certain
member of a college geology class who,
more ardent than methodical, was wont to investigate
outcrops and moraines with great enthusiasm,
but in utter ignorance of the points of
the compass. To this scatter-brained young
man the instructor used always to say, «Orient
yourself first of all, Mr. Jones, orient yourself.»
And so, before examining the individual
outcroppings of modern music, we shall do well
to orient ourselves in the artistic landscape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>Of all the composers with whom we are to
deal, Grieg and Dvo&#345;ák are the least inclusive
and catholic. Grieg, as we shall see, writes always
in the personal vein, is among musicians
what Leigh Hunt and Charles Lamb are among
writers. He is intimate, charming, graceful,
but never epic or universal. He touches the
great stream of musical tradition at a few points
only, and adds little to its volume. He knows
how to combine a few elements of effect with
finesse, but there are limitations both in what
he has to say and in his means of saying it.
He is familiar with only one dialect in the
language of tones. And if Grieg is personal,
Dvo&#345;ák is at most national. He is too deep-dyed
a Bohemian to be a complete citizen
of the world. Not only is his style curiously
provincial, with its uneven rhythms of folk-song,
its strong dance-like metrical schemes,
and its florid coloring, but his substance is too
ornate and too sweet to be profoundly significant.
He is a «natural» musician raised to
the n<sup>th</sup> power, but he is not enough a scholar
to relate himself very vitally with the general
growth of his art. Both of these men have
contributed much that is novel and charming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
to the lighter side of music, but they are not
masters of deep feeling and wide scope.</p>

<p>Camille Saint-Saëns and César Franck illustrate
strikingly another sort of partiality, a partiality
often met with in a less noticeable degree.
Each exemplifies only one of those contrasting
phases of feeling which we saw to underlie
Dance and Song, and which in the greatest
composers are combined. Saint-Saëns' work,
primarily expressive of active feeling, is strongly
metrical, derives its chief interest and value
from rhythmic qualities; Franck's, the product
of a singularly contemplative and monastic
nature, is monotonous in rhythm, but endlessly
various in melodic and harmonic treatment. In
the biographical essays the antithesis will be
brought out more in detail. Here it is only
necessary to suggest that, if these two French
composers are somewhat wider in scope than
Grieg or Dvo&#345;ák, their curious limitations in
temperament prevent them from doing all-inclusive
and universal work.</p>

<p>With Tschaïkowsky and Brahms we come
to men of a larger caliber. These two, different
as they are&mdash;the Russian finding in music primarily
a means of expression, the German
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
valuing more its plastic beauty&mdash;are, nevertheless,
the only two moderns who can be said to
carry on worthily the torch of Bach and Beethoven.
Both were men of sufficiently wide
sympathy and scholarship to approach music
with the utmost liberality, to get into contact
with all its traditions and utilize all its technical
resources. They write in that «grand style»
which draws its elements from the widest
sources, the style not of one man nor of one
nation, but of the world. Again, they were
men of complex temperament, capable of a
great range of feeling both active and contemplative.
Consequently the dance impulse and
the song impulse are equally operative in their
work, which has a richness and variety to be
found in Bach and Beethoven, but not in Saint-Saëns
or Franck. And though they were men
of the deepest emotion, they had also the intellectual
control over their work that made it not
only expressive but beautiful. In a word, the
range of their learning, the many-sidedness of
their temperaments, their emotional profundity
and their intellectual power, all conspired to
make them the greatest musicians of their
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet even between these two great men it is
possible, with the aid of our principles, to make
a distinction. We have seen that form is not
only a means of defining utterance, but that it
is furthermore the source of æsthetic delight,
and, through the reverberation of that, of an
immense reinforcement to expression; and we
have accordingly concluded that in no case
must form be sacrificed to any other factor of
effect whatsoever. To sacrifice form, in music,
whatever may seem at first sight the justification,
is in the long run to sacrifice the greater
for the less. Now Tschaïkowsky, led away by
the impetuosity of his feeling, is often guilty of
such a sacrifice. He gains for the moment;
he gains a compelling eloquence, the most exciting
effects, the wildest and most thrilling
crises. But in the long run he loses. Eventually
one tires of the crises, one is left cold, and
then the waywardness, the incoherence, the
lack of clear order and symmetry, are felt as
weaknesses. Too many of Tschaïkowsky's
pieces are better at a first hearing than at a
fifth. With Brahms it is otherwise. All his
emotion, deep, tender and noble as it is, is controlled
by the firm will and the shaping hand of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the supreme artist. However moving his
music may be, it is even more beautiful. His
faculties, whether by good fortune or merit, are
more perfectly adjusted than those of any other
modern composer. He is the most profound,
the most simple, the most comprehensive of
moderns, as becomes obvious when we test his
work by the principles we have laid down.
Others exemplify them partially, he most entirely;
others are great in some or several effects,
he is roundedly great. He allies himself with
all that was done in music before him, and contributes
indispensable elements to what will be
done in it hereafter. And so, if we arrange our
six composers in a series, determining the importance
of each by means of the universal and
impersonal principles of art, we must pass from
Grieg to Brahms.</p>

EDVARD GRIEG</p>
<hr class="style2"/>

<p>To the musical amateur no contemporary
composer is better known
than Grieg. Every school-girl
plays his piano pieces, young
violinists study his delightfully
melodious sonatas, and few concert pieces are
more widely loved than the Peer Gynt Suite.
Yet from professional musicians Grieg does not
meet with such favor. Many speak of him
patronizingly, some scornfully. «Grieg?» they
say. «Oh, yes, very charming, but&mdash;» and the
sentence ends with a shrug. The reason for this
discrepancy of estimate seems to be that the layman,
fascinated by Grieg's lovely melodies, unusual
and piquant harmonic treatment, and contagious
rhythm, looks for no further quality;
but the musician, unconsciously referring all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
music to a standard based on works of greater
solidity, greater breadth and force and passion
as well as wider learning and superior skill, is
too conscious of the shortcomings of this Norwegian
minstrelsy to do justice to its qualities.
It is, of a truth, music in which merit and failing
are curiously mingled; its delicate beauty is
unique, its limitation extreme. It is as fair as a
flower, and as fragile. It is, in short, the effluence
of a personality graceful without strength,
romantic without the sense of tragedy, highly
gifted with all gentle qualities of nature, but
lacking in the more virile powers, in broad vision,
epic magnanimity, and massive force.</p>

<p>Of this personality, as it appears in the flesh,
we get an interesting glimpse in Tschaïkowsky's
Diary.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
«During the rehearsal of Brahms's
new trio,» writes Tschaïkowsky, «as I was taking
the liberty of making some remarks as to the
skill and execution of the relative <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">tempo</i> 2-3&mdash;remarks
which were very good-naturedly received
by the composer&mdash;there entered the room
a very short, middle-aged man, exceedingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
fragile in appearance, with shoulders of unequal
height, fair hair brushed back from his forehead,
and a very slight, almost boyish beard and
mustache. There was nothing very striking
about the features of this man, whose exterior
at once attracted my sympathy, for it would be
impossible to call them handsome or regular;
but he had an uncommon charm, and blue eyes,
not very large, but irresistibly fascinating, recalling
the glance of a charming and candid child.
I rejoiced in the depths of my heart when we
were introduced to each other, and it turned out
that this personality which was so inexplicably
sympathetic to me belonged to a musician whose
warmly emotional music had long ago won
my heart. He proved to be the Norwegian
composer, Edvard Grieg.» This was in 1888,
when Grieg was forty-five. We may compare
with it another description, made a year later
by a Frenchman, M. Ernest Closson, when
Grieg was playing and conducting his works in
Paris. «Grieg is small, thin, and narrow-shouldered,»
writes M. Closson.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> «His body,
which is like a child's, is always in motion&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
movements short, lively, singularly jerky and
angular, each step shaking the whole body and
hitching the shoulder as if he limped; a 'bundle
of nerves' [«<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paquet des nerfs</i>»], to use a
doctor's phrase of picturesque energy. The
head, which looks massive on so small a body,
is intelligent and very handsome, with long
grayish hair thrown back, thin face, smooth-shaven
chin, short, thick mustache, small but
full nose, and eyes!&mdash;eyes superb, green, gray,
in which one can fancy one catches a glimpse of
Norway, with its melancholy fjords and its luminous
mists. His gaze is serious, wonderfully
soft, with a peculiar expression, at once worn,
tentative, and childishly naïve. The entire effect
is of kindness, gentleness, candor, a sincere
modesty.»</p>

<p>It is thus obvious that Grieg is of the nervous,
sensitive temperament, the temperament
of Keats and Stevenson, quick and ardent in
feeling, and in art notable for subjective, intimate
work rather than for the wide objective
point of view. Grieg's music is of value, indeed,
just because it is the artistic expression of
delicate personal feeling. We shall find that
his whole development tended toward a singularly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
individual, or at most national, utterance;
that his efforts toward a complexer or more
universal style, such as in poetry we call epic,
were unsuccessful; and that his real and inimitable
achievement is all in the domain of the
pure lyric.</p>

<p>Edvard Grieg was born in Bergen, Norway,
in 1843. At an early age he showed musical
talent, starting in to learn the piano and theory
at six, under his mother's direction. Gesine
Grieg, born Hagerup, descendent from a forceful
Norwegian family which had produced
some famous men, was a woman of musical and
poetic instinct and of strong character. She
had studied music in Hamburg and in London,
and given some concerts and many soirées in
Bergen. In a word, her son could not have
found a better guide in his first studies. At
nine Grieg surprised his school-teacher by submitting
in place of a literary composition a set
of original variations on a German melody, a
substitution which was not kindly received.
He was told to stop such nonsense. The
artistic temperament revealed itself also in great
sensitiveness to the beauty of the somber
Northern landscape, and at fifteen Grieg wished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
to become a painter. Fortunately, however,
his musical ability was recognized by the famous
violinist Ole Bull, at whose suggestion his
parents decided to send him to the Leipsic
Conservatory, whither he traveled in 1858.
Here again the romanticism of the boy showed
itself in his fretfulness under the strict régime of
his masters, Hauptmann, Richter, Rietz, Reinecke,
and Moscheles, and in his passionate
devotion to the works of Schumann and Chopin,
who were then looked upon in academic circles
as somewhat dangerous revolutionaries. Except
for a vacation of some months at home,
necessitated by the pulmonary trouble which
has ever since weakened Grieg's health, he
spent four years in the Conservatory, being
graduated in 1862.</p>

<p>In his earliest compositions, produced at this
period, the traits that afterwards distinguished
him are rather hampered by academic influences
and uncertainty of intention. The four
Pieces, opus 1, by no means devoid of his peculiar
flavor, are yet tentative in style and reminiscent
of older masters, particularly Chopin
and Mendelssohn. Of the Poetic Tone-pictures,
opus 3, the second and fourth are the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
well-established type of graceful <em>salon</em> piece.
Number four, indeed, might almost be a strayed
leaf from that gentle but hackneyed work
which some modern cynic has called the
«Songs without Music.» Yet the very next
piece is full-fledged Grieg. Here is the short
four-measure phrase, transposed a third and repeated,
here the descending chromatic harmonizations,
here the raucous fifths as of peasant
players, that we shall presently learn to look
for among the hall-marks of his writings. But
more important than any such technical details is
the general animation, producing trenchant
rhythm, graceful melody, and warm harmony,
that always sparkles in Grieg's best work. In
the Poetic Tone-pictures he is already himself,
though not his mature self.</p>

<p>Being at graduation somewhat bewildered
and uncertain as to his future course, Grieg
turned his steps in 1863 to the Danish capital,
the home of a great man whom he idolized.
«One day,» he writes in an autobiographical
fragment, «I had gone out with my friend
Matthison-Hansen to Klampenborg. Suddenly
he nudged my arm.</p>

<p>«'What is it?' I said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>«'Do you see that little man with the large
gray hat?'</p>

<p>«'I see him.'</p>

<p>«'Do you know who it is?' said he.</p>

<p>«'I haven't the least idea.'</p>

<p>«'That's Gade,' he said. 'Shall I introduce
you?'</p>

<p>«And without waiting for my reply he took
me up to the Professor, with the curt announcement:</p>

<p>«'Professor, a Norwegian friend of mine&mdash;a
good musician.'</p>

<p>«'Is it Nordraak?' asked Gade.</p>

<p>«'No, it is Grieg,' answered Matthison-Hansen.</p>

<p>«'Oh, that's who it is,' said Gade, scanning
my insignificant and humble self from head to
foot with a searching glance, while I stood, not
without awe, face to face with the man whose
works I treasured so highly. 'Have you something
to show me?'</p>

<p>«'No,' I answered. For the things I had
finished didn't seem good enough.</p>

<p>«'Then go home and write a symphony,'
recommended Gade.»</p>

<p>It is indicative of the groping stage at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
which Grieg's genius still paused that he actually
tried to write a symphony, two movements
of which are preserved in the Symphonic Pieces,
opus 14&mdash;Grieg, whose talent was symphonic
in about the degree that Brahms's was operatic.
Contact with the friendly little man in the large
gray hat, who has been dubbed the «Danish
Mendelssohn,» was doubtless a stimulus to the
young Grieg; but other and more radical influences
were needed to awaken his personality
and bring him to his own. Such influences,
however, he actually found in Copenhagen.
The «Nordraak» for whom Gade had at first
taken him, a fervently patriotic Norwegian of
magnetic personality, acquainted him with
Norwegian folk-songs and fired him with an
ambition to found on them a finished art.
Meeting in solemn conclave, with all the self-importance
of youth, these two enthusiasts
took the oath of musical allegiance to their
fatherland. «It was as though scales fell from
my eyes,» writes Grieg; «for the first time I
learned ... to understand my own nature.
We abjured the Gade-Mendelssohn insipid
and diluted Scandinavianism, and bound ourselves
with enthusiasm to the new path which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the northern school is now following.» Nor
did their zeal confine itself to composition.
In 1864 they founded, with their Danish friends
Horneman and Matthison-Hansen, the Euterpe
Musical Society, for the performance of Scandinavian
works. This institution, which must
have reacted stimulatingly on their composition,
they supported energetically up to Grieg's
departure in 1866 for Christiania. Finally, it
was in these years of his freshest vigor, in which
he was conscious both of inner power and of
outer opportunities, that Grieg met the lady,
Miss Nina Hagerup, his cousin, who became in
time his wife. It is not to be wondered at that
no period in his life was so fruitful as this.</p>

<p>His most characteristic works, accordingly,
were composed between his graduation from the
conservatory and the early seventies&mdash;between
his twentieth and his thirtieth years. There are
the two inimitable Sonatas for Violin and Piano,
opus 8 and 13; the Piano Sonata, opus 7; the
incidental music to Ibsen's Peer Gynt; some of
the most charming of the Lyric Pieces for piano
and of the Songs, and the Piano Concerto, opus
16; the best part, certainly, of his entire musical
product. It were a hopeless as well as useless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
task to describe in words the qualities of
these compositions. What shall one say in
words of the flavor of an orange? It is sweet?
Yes. And acid? Yes, a little. And it has a
delicate aroma, and is juicy and cool. But how
much idea of an orange has one conveyed then?
And similarly with this indescribably delicate
music of Grieg; there is little that can be pertinently
or serviceably said of it. One may point
out, however, its persistently lyrical character. It
is like the poetry of Mr. Henley in its exclusive
concern with moods, with personal emotions of
the subtlest, most elusive sort. It is intimate,
suggestive, intangible. It voices the gentlest
feelings of the heart, or summons up the airiest
visions of the imagination. It is whimsical, too,
changes its hues like the chameleon, and often
surprises us with a sudden flight to some unexpected
shade of expression. Again, its finesse
is striking. The phrases are polished like gems,
the melodies charm us with their perfect proportions,
the cadences are as consummate as
they are novel. Then, again, the rhythm is
most delightfully frank and straightforward;
there is no maundering or uncertainty, but always
a vigorous dancing progress, as candid as childhood.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
It is hard to keep one's feet still through
some of the Norwegian Dances. And though
in the Lyric Pieces rhythm is idealized, it is always
definite and clear, so that they are at the
opposite pole from all that formless sentimentality
which abandons accent in order to wail.
Again, we must notice the curious exotic flavor
of this music, a flavor not Oriental but northern,
a half-wild, half-tender pathos, outlandish
a little, but not turgid&mdash;on the contrary, perfectly
pellucid. An example is a little waltz
that figures as number two of the Lyric Pieces,
opus 12. Grieg's music, then, is lyrical, intimate,
shapely, and exotic, if such words mean anything&mdash;yes,
just as the orange is sweet, acid, and
aromatic. One who would feel the quality of
these works must hear them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Grieg is never large or
heroic; he never wears the buskin. He has
neither the depth of passion nor the intellectual
grasp needed to make music in the grand style.
Probably of all his peculiarities the most significant
is the shortness of his phrases and his
manner of repeating them almost literally, displaced
a little in pitch, but not otherwise altered.
Almost all his music can be cut up into segments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
two or four measures long, each segment
complete in itself, an entire musical thought.
If the reader will examine the little Waltz just
mentioned, for example, he will see that it is
constructed as follows: after two introductory
measures a phrase of melody is announced, four
measures in length; this is immediately repeated,
at the same pitch but slightly varied in
rhythm; then enters another phrase, two measures
long, which is repeated literally a third
lower; its latter half is twice echoed, and there
is a two-measure cadence. All is then repeated.
The middle part of the piece, in A major, is
built in much the same way; after it the first
part is given once more, and there is a short
coda. The construction of this charming piece,
in a word, is very like that of the passages from
primers that are familiar to us all: «Is this
a boy? This is a boy. Has the boy a dog?
The boy has a dog. This is the dog of the
boy.» And Grieg's coda adds meditatively,
«Of the boy ... the boy ... boy.»
His thoughts complete themselves quickly; they
have little span, and they are combined, not by
interfusion, but by juxtaposition. He never
weaves a tapestry; he assembles a mosaic. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
have only to compare his music with that of
some great master, of wide scope and large
synthetic power, like Brahms or Beethoven, to
feel precisely in what sense he is lyrical rather
than heroic, charming rather than elevated, suggestive
rather than informative. Compare, for
instance, with his waltz, the waltz of Brahms,
number eight in opus 39. Here there is a sustained
flight of twelve measures, the tune poising
and soaring as it were on a rising or falling
breeze, or like a kite that now dips and now is
up again, but never touches the earth. It is
interesting to play the two waltzes one after the
other, noting the difference in effect between
the precise, dainty, clipped phrases of the one
and the broad-spanned arch of melody of the
other. Such contrasts are at the basis of all
significant discriminations of musical form.</p>

<p>How much the «short breath» of Grieg is
due to the nature of his thematic material is a
difficult question to answer. Folk-tunes, it is
certain, are simple in structure, composed of
short phrases expressing the naïve emotions of
childlike minds. On the other hand, had they
not fulfilled Grieg's personal needs, supplying
the sort of atmosphere he was meant to breathe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
in, he could never have assimilated them as he
has done. Perhaps a true account of the matter
is that his nature is of such unusual simplicity
and ingenuousness as to find in folk-melodies
its natural utterance, and to feel in
their primitive phrase-structure no limitation.
Intellectually, the man is not more mature
than the people. From whatever sources he
might draw his germinal ideas, he would never
combine them in complexer forms or larger patterns
than he has found ready-made to his
hand in the national song. There are, however,
in Norwegian music peculiarities of a different
sort that we can hardly conceive as proving
other than hindrances in the formation of a
wholesomely eclectic style&mdash;peculiarities which
are all present full-fledged in so early a work
of Grieg as the Piano Concerto, opus 16, written
in 1868. At the very outset, in the descending
octave passage, there are two melodic tricks
that recur everywhere in Grieg&mdash;the fall from
the seventh of the scale to the fifth, and from
the third to the tonic. Both progressions, anomalous
in classic music, are prominent features
of the Northern folk-tunes. Then, in the first
theme, assigned to the orchestra, there are to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
be noticed, besides these melodic steps, the
bodily displacement of the phrase already described,
carrying it from A minor into C major.
In the second theme, as well as in the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cantabile</i>
piano passage that prepares the way for it, there
is a rhythmic device characteristic of Grieg&mdash;the
mixing in one measure of three notes to the
beat with two notes to the beat, of which the
prototype is to be found in the «Springtanz»
of Norwegian peasants. Here also is the weak
cadence, that is to say, the cadence with tonic
chord coming on an unaccented beat. So
much for melodic and rhythmic peculiarities;
as a harmonist Grieg has methods equally persistent.
His love of bare fifths, reiterated in
the bass with boorish vigor, and his manner of
harmonizing with descending chromatic sixths
or thirds, both of which we remarked in opus 3,
are illustrated in this Concerto; the first in the
conclusion-theme of the first movement, and
the second in measures fourteen to sixteen of
the beautiful Adagio. Finally, he is devoted
to the secondary sevenths, especially in harsh
and daring sequence such as make up most of
the Norwegian March, opus 54, No. 2. Mannerisms
like these Grieg has, on the whole, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
far larger measure than most composers. On
almost any of his pages the student will have no
difficulty in finding for himself instances of one
or more of these mannerisms.</p>

<p>Now, so many little tricks and idiosyncrasies,
however piquant in the work of a beginner,
could hardly escape becoming, as time went
on, an incubus to even the most vigorous imagination.
Nothing menaces thought more than
affectations and whimsicalities of style. And
even in the meridian of Grieg's activity, when
he was charming a staid world with the fresh
beauties of the Piano Sonata and the two early
Violin Sonatas, there were not wanting critics
who discerned his danger and foresaw that he
must either broaden his methods or deteriorate.
Over twenty years ago the following words were
written in an English magazine by Frederick
Niecks: «My fear in the case of Grieg always
was that his love of Norwegian idioms would
tend to narrow, materialize, and make shallow
his conceptions, and prevent him from forming
a style by imposing on him a manner.» Subsequent
events have proved that this fear was
but too well founded. Although, during the
years at Copenhagen, and the eight years, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
1866 to 1874, that Grieg lived in Christiania
teaching and conducting, he continued to do
excellent work, he seems to have even then
reached the acme of his powers, and thenceforward
to have imperceptibly declined. It is
rather a melancholy fact that when, in 1874,
receiving a pension of sixteen hundred crowns
from the Government, which enabled him to resign
the conductorship of the Musical Union
of Christiania, he began to devote himself almost
entirely to composition, his mental vivacity
was waning and his lovely lyrical utterance
was beginning to be smothered under mannerisms.
From this time on he advanced more by
familiarizing the world with his earlier compositions
than by adding to them anything particularly
novel or precious. He traveled in Germany,
Holland and Denmark, gave concerts
in England in 1888, and visited France a year
later, playing and conducting his works at Paris.
For the rest, he retired to his picturesque villa,
Troldhangen, ten miles from Bergen, where he
lives a peaceful and secluded country life.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to see why Grieg's later
works should decline rather than advance. In
the first place, his interest had been from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
first concentrated on personal expression. His
impulse was individual, not universal. He
never sought to widen or deepen the forms of
musical beauty, to extend the range of resources
at the command of musicians; he merely used
what he found ready-made to voice his own poetic
feeling. In this he succeeded admirably.
In the second place, charmed by the exotic
quality of Norwegian music, a quality that he
found also in his own nature, he adopted the
native idiom with eagerness, and spent the years
most composers devote to learning the musical
language in acquiring&mdash;a dialect. Thirdly, his
mind was of the type which cares much for
beauty of ornament&mdash;even more, perhaps, than
for a highly wrought harmony of line and form.
It was the inevitable result of these three circumstances
that, first, he should reach his highest
activity in early youth, when romantic feeling
is at its acme and thought habitually subjective,
and thereafter decline; second, that the
dialect which at first was so charming, with its
unfamiliar words and its bewitching accent,
should eventually reveal its paucity and its provincialism;
and finally, that a mind naturally
fond of rich detail, neglectful of large shapeliness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
should have recourse, in the ebb of inner
impulse, to transcription, paraphrase, and all
the other devices for securing superficial ornament
and luxury of effect. With opus 41 Grieg
began transcribing his own songs for the piano,
dressing up the simple melodies in all sorts of
arpeggios, curious harmonies, and other musical
decorations; and between his fiftieth and
seventieth opus-numbers there is little but representation
of Norwegian tunes, now in one
guise and now in another, but seldom indeed
with any of the old novel charm. (A trace of
it there is, perhaps, in opus 62, No. 2, and again
in opus 80, No. 4.) The extraordinary pyrotechnical
display that the transcription, opus 41,
No. 5, makes out of so simple a song as «The
Princess» is branded by M. Closson as «un
crime de lèse-art.» And to one who has felt
the magic of the Kuhreigen, opus 17, No. 22,
it is saddening to turn to the same melody
as it appears in opus 63, No. 2, with all its
maiden grace brushed and laced and furbelowed
into an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la mode</i> elegance and vacuity. Thus
Grieg has not, like the more cosmopolitan, objective,
and universal composers, advanced in
his work up to the very end. As years have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
progressed, the accidental in it, the inessential,
has become more prominent, has tended to obscure
what is vital and beautiful. As the spirit
waned, the letter has become more rigidly insistent.
Idiosyncrasy has supplanted originality.
To find the true Grieg, supple, spontaneous,
and unaffected, we must go back to the early
works.</p>

<p>When all is said, however, Grieg has in these
early works made a contribution to music which
our sense of his later shortcomings must not
make us forget. His Piano Sonata and his
Violin Sonatas supply chamber-music with a
note of pure lyric enthusiasm, of fresh unthinking
animation, not elsewhere to be found. His
Peer Gynt Suite fills a similar place among
orchestral works. His best piano pieces, and,
above all, his lovely and too little known songs,
are unique in their delicate voicing of the tenderest,
most elusive personal feeling, as well as
in their consummate finesse of workmanship.
It is a Lilliputian world, if you will, but a fair
one. That art of the future which Grieg predicts
in his essay on Mozart, which «will unite
lines and colors in marriage, and show that it
has its roots in all the past, that it draws sustenance
from old as well as from new masters,»
will acknowledge in Grieg himself the source
of one indispensable element&mdash;the element of
naïve and spontaneous romance.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>B<small>IBLIOGRAPHICAL</small> N<small>OTE.</small><small>&mdash;Grieg has had the good sense to
publish almost all of his works in the inexpensive and excellent
Peters Edition. The amateur will wish to acquaint himself first
of all with some such representative pieces as the following:
Piano-pieces&mdash;Poetic tone-pictures, op. 3, Humoreskes, op. 6,
Sonata, op. 7, Northern Dances, op. 17, Albumblatter, op. 28,
and the Lyric Pieces, op. 12, 38, 43, and 47 (op. 54, 57, 62,
65, and 68 are inferior). Four hand arrangements&mdash;Elegiac
Melodies, op. 34, Norwegian Dances, op. 35, and the first
Peer Gynt Suite, op. 40. Chamber-music&mdash;the three Sonatas
for Violin and Piano and the 'Cello Sonata, op. 36. Of the
songs, sixty are printed in the five «Albums» of the Peters
Edition. The second contains half a dozen of Grieg's most
perfect songs, among them «I Love Thee,» «Morning
Dew,» «Parting» and «Wood Wanderings.» «To Springtime»
in Album I, «A Swan» and «Solvejg's Song» in
Album III, and «By the Riverside,» «The Old Mother,»
and «On the Way Home» in Album IV, are also characteristic
and beautiful. The reader who feels Grieg's charm at all
will end by buying all five Albums, though there is little of
value in the last.</small></p>

<p class="p4 center">III<br />
ANTONIN DVO&#344;ÁK</p>
<hr class="style2"/>

<p>On an October evening in 1892
there was given in New York
City a «Grand Concert» in exploitation
of the «Eminent Composer
and Director of the National
Conservatory of Music of America,» Dr.
Antonin Dvo&#345;ák. There was an orchestra of
eighty, a chorus of three hundred, and an audience
of several thousand; the ceremonies, partly
hospitable and partly patriotic, included an oration,
the presentation of a silver wreath, and the
singing of «America» by the assembled multitude.
Outwardly picturesque as the occasion
doubtless was, it must have been even more
striking in its suggestion of the extreme contrasts
in life which accompany the turning of
fortune's wheel. Here was a man, originally a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Bohemian peasant, a village butcher's son, who
for years had endured the most grinding poverty,
the most monotonous obscurity, the most
interminable labor for power and recognition,
coming at last, a famous musician, to hear his
works performed and his genius extolled in a
great, enthusiastic country that wanted, and was
«willing to pay for,» a school of music. Even
statistics are eloquent when character is behind
them; at a salary of fifteen thousand dollars a
year the National Conservatory of America had
engaged as principal the composer who, less than
twenty years before, had been pensioned by the
Austrian Ministry of Education just one hundredth
of that sum. Dvo&#345;ák's reception in New
York was an appropriate outward sign of a victory
achieved over peculiarly indifferent destiny
by peculiarly indomitable pluck.</p>

<p>As one looks back from this imposing event
over the course of Dvo&#345;ák's laborious, persistent
youth, one's attention, no matter how much
it is at first engaged with the changes of his
outer life, with his progress from obscure poverty
to comfort and fame, soon dwells even more
on the underlying identity of the man through
all changes, on his unswerving simplicity of nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
and steadfastness of aim. More remarkable
than the diversity of his career is the unity
of his character. From first to last, whether in
Mühlhausen, Prague, London, or New York,
he is essentially a peasant. His deepest moral
trait is the dumb persistence, the unthinking
doggedness, of the peasant. His mental atmosphere
is the peasant's innocence of self-consciousness,
his unintrospective candor. Not
like the sophisticated man, who weighs motives
and foresees obstacles, does he pursue his troublous
way. He is, on the contrary, like an engine
placed on the track and started; through
darkness and day, through failure and success,
through weakness and strength, he steams ahead,
ever propelled by irresistible inner force, insensible
and unamenable to circumstance. And
his musical impulse is of the same sort. His
aims in music have always been simple, definite,
unsophisticated by intellectualism. Taking keen
delight in the sensuous beauty of sound, gifted
with the musical sense in its most fundamental
form of physical susceptibility, from his earliest
days he set about learning to produce pleasant
effects of rhythm and consonance, with utter
sincerity, with no reference to derivative and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
secondary musical values. When, as a boy, he
heard the villagers playing their native dances,
his blood stirred in sympathy, and as soon as
he was able he took a hand. When he was
older he invented similar pieces, gradually refining
them, but always cherishing the brightness
of tone, the vigor of rhythmic life, that had first
won his devotion. And when, in New York,
an experienced and honored musician, he was
expected to advise our composers, it was highly
characteristic of him that he recommended them
to pour their ideas into the negro molds. Here
was a music simple, sensuous, highly rhythmic;
he looked no further, he was disconcerted by no
ethnological problems, nor even by the incongruity
that any man of the world would have
seen between negro song and our subtly mingled,
highly complex American character. Bohemian
folk-melodies had expressed him; why should
not plantation tunes express us? But perhaps
his curious simplicity reveals itself most of all
in his perfectly uncritical fecundity as a composer.
He writes with extreme rapidity, and indefatigably.
The great Stabat Mater is said to
have been completed in six weeks, and his opus
numbers extend beyond a hundred. He writes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
as if nothing existed in the world but himself
and an orchestra waiting to play his scores. He
is never embarrassed by a sense of limitation, by
the perception in others of powers he lacks.
Though he has studied the masters, he is not
abashed by them. The standards of scholarship,
those academic bugbears, have for him no
terrors. Indeed, of all great composers he is
perhaps least the scholar, most the sublimated
troubadour, enriching the world with an apotheosized
tavern-music. In reading his life we
must never forget these things: his simple nature,
his sensuous rather than emotional or intellectual
devotion to music, and his immunity
from the checks and palsies of wide learning and
fastidious taste.</p>

<p>There is in a rural district of Bohemia, on
the Moldau River, a quiet little village called
Nelahozeves, or, in German, Mühlhausen,<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>
where, in 1841, was born Antonin, eldest son
of Frantisek Dvo&#345;ák, the village innkeeper and
butcher. The Dvo&#345;áks were people not without
consideration among their fellow-townsmen; not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>only was mine host of the tavern a widely acquainted
man, but his wife's father was bailiff
to a prince. One may imagine the potency, in
a small hamlet, of such a conjunction of prominence
and prestige. Nevertheless, as social
distinction has no direct effect on a man's income,
and as the butcher's family grew in the
course of years inconveniently numerous, it
happened that Antonin, the eldest of eight
children, was looked to in early youth to learn
his father's trade and contribute toward the
family support. Unfortunately, he wished to
be a musician. Such a desire, indeed, chimerical
as it may have appeared at the time, was
natural enough in a boy of musical sensibility
who had been surrounded from his earliest years
by a people passionately devoted to music.
Not only is music a part of the instruction in
the Bohemian public schools, but it is the adjunct
of all the occasions of life. As many as
forty dances are said to be practiced by the
peasants, and we have it on Dvo&#345;ák's own
authority that laborers in Bohemia sing at their
work, and after church on Sunday begin dancing,
which they «often keep up without cessation
till early on the following morning.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>»
Taking advantage of his opportunities, the boy
had learned at fourteen to play the violin,
the organ, and the piano, and to sing. It
was a year later that, summoned by his
father to surrender his dreams of musicianship,
he performed an exploit well worth
mentioning, as an early example of his indefatigable
persistence and his blundering
methods. Hoping to enlist his father's sympathy,
he wrote, scored, and had played by the
village band, an original polka. Mr. Hadow
tells the story at length; its point is that
Dvo&#345;ák, whose ambition was more robust than
his learning, failed to write the trumpets as
transposing instruments, and, of course, made a
distressing fiasco. «There is some little irony
in the disaster,» comments Mr. Hadow, «if it
be remembered that among all Dvo&#345;ák's gifts
the instinct of orchestration is perhaps the most
conspicuous. He is the greatest living exponent
of the art; and he was once in danger of
forfeiting his career through ignorance of its
most elementary principle.» He did, indeed,
give up music for a year, but in October, 1857,
was allowed by his father to enter the Organ
School at Prague.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>Had Dvo&#345;ák been of an introspective turn
of mind, he might now have wondered rather
dismally, as the months went by in Prague, the
paternal allowance ceased, and the tuition at
the Organ School proved narrow and technical,
whether he had really benefited himself. Fortunately,
he was not given to metaphysical
speculation; he got what training he could from
the school and joined a band. In Mühlhausen
he had often taken a viola part in the village
band that played for weddings and on holidays;
now he turned his skill to account in the restaurants
of Prague. In this way, and by playing
also in a church orchestra on Sundays, he
managed to amass about nine dollars a month,
and to acquire an instinct for the way instrumental
parts should be written. The only obvious
advantage of this trying period was the
intimate knowledge of instruments it gave him.
He lived, so to speak, cheek by jowl with them,
watching them, handling them, seeing what was
written for them, and hearing how it sounded.
His is no book-knowledge of orchestration. On
the other hand, his extreme poverty, the limitations
of the school, and his lack of friends to
lend him scores or the use of a piano, cut him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
off cruelly from that equally essential part of
education, familiarity with classic masterpieces
and the traditions of academic learning. His
band played only popular overtures and the
usual pot-pourris. Sometimes he coaxed a kettle-drummer
to let him crouch behind the
drums and hear a concert. He once had an
opportunity to hear «Der Freischütz» for the
modest sum of four cents, but the four cents was
not forthcoming, and «Der Freischütz» went
unheard. He could afford to buy no scores,
and there was no library where he could read
them. Such were the meager advantages of
which he made good use; such the heavy obstacles
he gradually surmounted.</p>

<p>After his graduation from the Organ School
in 1860 his situation, both practical and musical,
slowly ameliorated. From Smetana, who gave
him a position in the orchestra of the Interimstheater,
a home for Bohemian opera founded in
1862, he received what was of even more importance
to him, the loan of scores and encouragement
in composition. Already twenty-one, he
acquainted himself for the first time with Beethoven's
and Mendelssohn's symphonies and
chamber-works, of which he became a passionate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
student, and with Schumann's songs. For almost
ten years he labored steadily and silently. It
was the period of apprenticeship, the period of
arduous, slow mastery of technique and thought
through which every creative artist must pass.
The mere mass of his exercises is bewildering;
he composed and destroyed an opera and two
symphonies, to say nothing of many other
sacrifices on the altar of skill of which not even
the names survive. Peculiar to himself, to be
sure, and scarcely a model for other students,
was his method in this long self-evocation. Not
like Beethoven did he meditate and revise his
themes, spending infinite labor on sixteen bars
of melody, and not quailing before a dozen revisions
so they were needed to pare away the
marble and reveal the perfect form. Not like
Brahms did he install a systematic training, day
by day winning strength and plasticity of thought
on the chest-weights and dumb-bells of contrapuntal
exercise. On the contrary, he forged
ahead, and somehow, without knowing where
he was going or what he was doing, made himself
a master. He took Parnassus by storm,
as it were, overran rather than scaled it, and
was victor more by quantity than by quality of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
performance. Yet in all this blundering progress
he was protected by a genuine elevation of
aim. Lacking the sense of tradition and the
safeguards of scrupulous taste, he was not without
his own rugged idealism. And so, although
he doubtless had every external inducement to
join the ranks of the national movement in
music, then just acquiring momentum, he maintained
his conscientious silence for nearly a decade.
His compositions saw the light neither
of the concert hall nor of the printing-press;
written with ardor, they were burned without
regret. Dvo&#345;ák showed in his <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">lehrjähre</i> the
self-respect of all really great artists.</p>

<p>It was early in the seventies that he finally
emerged from his studious reserve and appeared
before the world with an opera, «The King and
the Collier,» which he was commissioned to
write for the National Theater. So clear was
the patriotic intent of this commission, so entirely
was the popular interest enlisted in Smetana's
effort to build up a Bohemian school of music,
that it is hard to conceive how Dvo&#345;ák could
have fallen into the error he now made. He
prepared for his fellow-countrymen a Wagnerian
music-drama. The situation is comic.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
The good Bohemians, come to hear folk-tunes,
were given leit-motifs and «infinite melody.»
If they failed to sympathize with his adoration
for the Bayreuth master (and it seems indeed to
have been but a calf-sickness, afterwards bravely
outlived), if «The King and the Collier»
was a flat failure, Dvo&#345;ák had no one but himself
to blame. At this point, however, as at so
many others in his career, his unfailing energy
saved the day so nearly lost by what one critic
has called his «brainlessness.» He set to
and rewrote his work entire, leaving not a single
number of the unhappy music-drama. But
now the libretto, which had at first been spared
a disapproval all concentrated upon the music,
proved worthless and flat, and the opera was
damned afresh. Still Dvo&#345;ák persisted. Getting
a poet to set an entirely new «book» to his
entirely new music, he made at last a success
with an opera of which Mr. Hadow well says
that «the Irishman's knife, which had a new
blade and a new handle, does not offer a more
bewildering problem of identity.» No one but
Dvo&#345;ák would have so bungled his undertaking;
no one but he would so have forced it to
a successful issue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>By 1873 Dvo&#345;ák was well started on the
career of increasing power and fame that he had
worked so hard to establish on firm foundations.
That year was marked not only by his installment
as organist at St. Adalbert's Church, with
a comfortable salary, and by his marriage, but
also by the appearance of a composition which
made his name at once widely known in Bohemia&mdash;the
patriotic hymn entitled «The Heirs
of the White Mountain.» Four years later his
reputation began to spread beyond the border.
It was in 1877 that the approbation of Brahms,
then a commissioner of the Austrian Ministry
of Education, to which Dvo&#345;ák had submitted
some duets, induced Joachim to introduce the
young Bohemian's works into England and Germany,
and the house of Simrock to publish
them. In 1878 the Slavonic Dances made their
composer's name immediately known throughout
the musical world. His great Stabat Mater,
produced in England with acclaim in 1883, was
the first of several choral works given there in
the next few years, all very successfully. In 1889
he was decorated by the Austrian court. In
1890 he received an Honorary Doctorate from
the University of Cambridge, was made Doctor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
of Philosophy at Prague, and was appointed
Professor of Composition at the Conservatory
there. The welcome accorded to him in America
has already been briefly chronicled. His
sixtieth birthday was celebrated by a musical
festival in 1901, at Prague, where he now makes
his home. In Dvo&#345;ák's varied life a youth of
unusual hardship, of an almost unparalleled
severity of struggle both for livelihood and for
education, has been crowned with years full of a
prosperity and honor rarely allotted to composers.</p>

<p>That time-honored tool of artistic criticism,
the distinction between thought and expression&mdash;or,
as the critics say, between <em>ethos</em> and technique&mdash;is
one that constantly tempts the critic
of music, and always betrays him. Very seductive
it is, because analogy with other arts is
so plausible a device for exploiting music; but
push it to its logical outcome and it inevitably
vanishes&mdash;the form proves to be not the investiture,
nor even the incarnation, of the thought,
but the thought itself. Change the expression
and you annihilate the thought; develop a
technique and you create a system of ideas;
mind and body are ultimately one. Now the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
case of Dvo&#345;ák is strongly corroborative of
such a theory of the identity in music of <em>ethos</em>
and technique. What is seen from one angle
of vision as his love of exotic color, his devotion
to curious intervals of melody, sudden excursions
in tonality, and odd molds of rhythm,
appears from the other, the technical side,
as mastery of orchestral sonority and inheritance
of a peculiar musical dialect. It is therefore
difficult to account exactly for the genesis
of any given quality in his work. Is it the result
of an outer influence acting upon a peculiarly
plastic nature, or does it spring rather
from deeply-rooted individual traits that have
dominated the course of his development and
shaped his style? Did his early experiences in
a village band, for example, awaken and evolve
his sense of tone color, or would his music
have been primarily sensuous even if he had
had the training of Brahms, Tschaïkowsky, or
César Franck? It seems probable that here, as
elsewhere, inner endowment and outer influence
have reacted with a subtlety and complexity
that defy analysis, and thought and style are
but aspects of one essence. Consequently, the
difference between <em>ethos</em> and technique, however
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
serviceable as a means of getting over the
ground, as a tool of investigation, will mislead
us unless we constantly remember how partial
is its validity. We may indeed, for the sake
of clearness and thoroughness, speak first of
one aspect, then of another, but the man we are
studying, like the shield in the allegory, remains
all the time one.</p>

<p>To approach the technical side first, there
can be no doubt that the rich quality of
Dvo&#345;ák's tone, a quality so striking that Mr.
Hadow places him with Beethoven, Berlioz,
and Wagner in the class of supreme masters of
orchestration, would never have been attainable
to one who had not had his peculiar experience.
He has the practical player's exhaustive knowledge
of instruments, which enables him, by
disposing the parts always in effective registers,
to get a rich and mellow sonority in his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ensemble</i>
writing. Examine any chord in his scores, and
you see that each player gives a tone that he
can sound fully and advantageously, and that
each choir of instruments&mdash;the strings, the
wood, the brass&mdash;gives in isolation an effective
chord. The resultant harmony is a well-balanced,
thoroughly fused mass of tone. But far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
more important than the power to write effectively
disposed single chords is the power to
weave a fabric of close texture and firm consistency,
to make the orchestra sustain, ramify,
and reinforce itself, so to speak. By far the
best way to secure this solidity of texture is to
write coherent and well-individualized melodies
in the different parts, which serve as strands to
bind the whole. Such is the method of Beethoven
among classic and of Tschaïkowsky
among romantic composers, and so efficient is
good polyphonic or «many-voiced» writing as
a means of sonority that it has been truly said,
«Pure voice-leading is half an orchestra.» Yet
great skill is required for such polyphonic writing,
since all the independent melodies must
cooperate harmoniously; and Dvo&#345;ák, who got
little academic training as a boy, is not a great
contrapuntist. Just here, however, his band
experience coming to his aid, he was saved
from writing lumpish, doughy stuff&mdash;in which
one poor tune in the soprano vainly attempts
to hold up a heavy weight of amorphous «accompaniment»&mdash;by
his extraordinary knack of
vitalizing his entire mass of tone through rhythmic
individualization of the parts. Taking a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
skeleton of simple harmony, he manages to write
for the different voices such salient and individual
rhythms that they stand out with almost
the grace of melodious contrapuntal parts. It
is a sort of metrical yeast to keep his bread
from being soggy. Numerous examples will at
once occur to students of his scores, particularly
from the Slavonic Dances and Rhapsodies. A
third form of his orchestral mastery might be
pointed out in the well-calculated special effects
for single instruments, such as the oboe duet
that concludes the first movement of the Suite,
opus 39, which occur everywhere in his scores.
But that is, after all, a commoner form of skill,
whereas rich sonority and life in the fabric as
the result of rhythmic individualization of the
parts, can be found in few scores so highly developed
as in those of Dvo&#345;ák.</p>

<p>As regards structure, Dvo&#345;ák is felicitous but
eccentric. He does not lay out his plans with
the careful prevision of one to whom balance
and symmetry are vital. His scheme is not
foreordered, it is sketched currently. Thus,
for example, his modulation is singularly radical,
impulsive and haphazard. He loves to
descend unexpectedly upon the most remote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
keys, never knows where he will turn next, and
when he gets too far from home returns over
fences and through no-thoroughfares. Often,
with him, a change of key seems dictated merely
by a desire for a particular patch of color; he
wishes to brighten the tonal background with
sharps or mollify it with flats, and plump he
comes to his key, little caring how he gets there
or where he is going next. His use of contrasts
of tonality is thus characteristic of his love of
color-effects for themselves and his willingness
to subordinate to them purity of line. Again,
it is probably not forcing the point to see in his
use of uneven rhythms, such as five and seven
bar periods, another instance of the same tendency
to license. Undoubtedly in part a
legacy from Bohemian folk-song, which is
particularly rich in them, his uneven rhythms
seem to be also in part due to a certain fortuitousness
of mind. It is as if he closed his
phrase, without regard to strict symmetry,
wherever a good chance offered. The theme
of the Symphonic Variations, opus 78, is an example.
It is interesting to contrast this rhythmic
trait of Dvo&#345;ák's with Grieg's accurate and
sometimes almost wearisome precision of outline.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Both men derive from folk-music a love
of incisive meter&mdash;their music has a strong
pulse; but Grieg, who is precise, lyrical, sensitive
to perfection of detail, is really finical in
his unfaltering devotion to square-cut sections,
while Dvo&#345;ák, more wayward, less perfect and
exquisite, strays into all sorts of odd periods.
His somewhat arbitrary treatment of tonality
relations and of rhythm is thus illustrative of a
general laxity of method highly characteristic of
the man. In contrast with a jealously accurate
artist like Grieg, he is felicitous more by
force of genius than by wisdom of intent.</p>

<p>Dvo&#345;ák's childlike spontaneity is in no way
better exemplified than by his attitude toward
folk-music, and here again he may profitably be
contrasted with Grieg. Both devotees of local
color have enriched art with unfamiliar lineaments
and unused resources, yet their modes
of procedure have been quite different. Grieg,
traversing the usual mill of German musical
education, turned consciously to Norwegian
folk-song to find a note of individuality.
Struck with the freshness of the native dances,
he transplanted them bodily into his academic
flower-pots. His courtship of the national
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Muse was conscious, sophisticated, and his
style is in a sense the result of excogitation.
Dvo&#345;ák, on the contrary, growing up in his
small Bohemian village, unable to get classic
scores, assiduously fiddling throughout his
youth at village fêtes where the peasants must
have a scrap of tune to dance by, became thoroughly
saturated with the rude music. It
moved in his veins like blood; it was his other
language. Thus the two men were at quite
polar standpoints in relation to nationalism.
With Dvo&#345;ák it was a point of departure, with
Grieg it was a goal of pilgrimage. And so,
while the Norwegian has tended to immure
himself in idiosyncrasy, the Bohemian has
rubbed off provincialisms without losing his inheritance.
His music, while retaining the sensuous
plenitude, the individual flavor, the florid
coloring, with which his youth endowed it, has
acquired, with years and experience, a scope of
expression, a maturity of style, and a universality
of appeal that make it as justly admired as
it is instinctively enjoyed.</p>

<p>Imperceptibly we have passed from technical
analysis into personal inventory. And indeed,
all Dvo&#345;ák's peculiarities of style may be viewed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
as the inevitable manifestations of a nature at
once rich and naïve. His music makes a delightfully
frank appeal. It is never somber,
never crabbed, never even profound. It breathes
not passion, but sentiment. It is too happily
sensuous to be tragic, too busy with an immediate
charm to trouble about a remote meaning.
Even when he is moving, as in the Largo
of the New World Symphony, is it not with a
gentle, half-sensuous pathos, a wistfulness more
than half assuaged by the wooing sweetness of
the sounds that fill our ears? To him music
is primarily sweet sound, and we shall misconceive
his aim and service if in looking for something
deep in him we miss what is, after all, very
accessible and delightful for itself&mdash;the simple
charm of his combinations of tone.</p>

<blockquote>


<p>B<small>IBLIOGRAPHICAL</small> N<small>OTE.</small>
<small>&mdash;Dvo&#345;ák's fecundity is surprising.
He has written cantatas, oratorios, a mass, a requiem, and hymns
for chorus and orchestra; five symphonies, five overtures, four
symphonic poems, the well-known Slavonic Dances and Rhapsodies,
concertos for piano, violin, and violoncello, the inimitable
Suite, op. 39, the Symphonic Variations, op. 78, and other orchestral
works of smaller proportions; seven string quartets, a
sextet, three trios, a terzetto for two violins and a viola, two
string quintets, a piano quintet, a piano quartet, a sonata for violin
and piano, and a serenade for wind instruments; and, finally,
many piano works and songs. He is at his best in his orchestral
and chamber works, of which the following are typical: the
Slavonic Dances, op. 46 and 72, the Slavonic Rhapsodies, op.
45, the Suite, op. 59, the Symphony, «From the New World,»
op. 95, and the Scherzo Capriccioso, op. 66; the Sextet, op.
48, the Quartet and Quintet on negro themes, op. 96 and 97,
the Piano Quintet, op. 81, and the Piano Quintet, op. 87.
Though these compositions lose much in transcription, they are
all obtainable in four-hand piano arrangements. The piano
music is somewhat unidiomatic except the later things, but the
Mazurkas, op. 56, the Poetische Stimmungsbilder, op. 85, and
the Humoreskes, op. 101, are worth knowing. Of the songs,
nine of the best are published separately by the house of Simrock,
and the two most popular ones, «Gute Nacht» and
«Als die Alte Mutter,» are to be had in Schirmer's series entitled
«Gems of German Songs.» A study of these will probably
arouse a desire for more, and the student may buy the Gipsy
Songs, op. 55, and the Love Songs, op. 83. The duets,
«Klänge aus Mähren,» not very well known, are characteristic.</small></p>

<p>It is a principle of musical expression
that of the two great types of temperament,
the active and the contemplative,
the first tends to express
itself in strongly rhythmic figures,
the second in phrases of vaguer outline, full of
sentiment not easily to be confined in molds.
The man of action is incisive, vigorous, compact
in utterance; the mystic is by contrast
indefinite and discursive. It has been well established,
indeed, that primeval music was the
product of two modes of instinctive emotional
expression, the gesticulatory and the vocal,
dance and song; and throughout its growth
these two strands, however closely they may
intertwine, can still be traced. Thus it happens
that even to-day we find the complex work of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
modern musicians getting a special impress of
personality and style according as the rhythmic
or the melodic-harmonic faculty predominates
in the individual. One man's music will be
notable for its strong impulse, its variety and
vivacity of rhythm; another's will appeal to the
more dreamy and sentimental part of our
natures, will speak to our hearts so movingly
that we shall recognize its descent from the
song rather than from the dance. And in all
such cases the first man will be of the active
temperament, a man of the world, of many interests
and great nervous force; the second
will be contemplative, inclined to the monastic
life, and of great heart rather than keen intelligence.</p>

<p>Such an antithesis of artistic product and of
personal character exists in a peculiar degree
between Camille Saint-Saëns and César Franck,
the two greatest composers France has produced
since Bizet. Each of these men is great
by virtue of qualities somewhat wanting in the
other. The one is clever, worldly, learned&mdash;and
a little superficial; the other, profound, religious,
of singularly pure and exalted spirit, is
yet emotional to the verge of abnormality. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
so with their music; that of Saint-Saëns is
energetic, lucid, consummately wrought, while
Franck's, more moving and more subtle, is
so surcharged with feeling as to become vague
and inarticulate. A review of their lives and a
brief analysis of their work will bring out more
clearly this divergence of nature, which, in spite
of the many traits they have in common, has
determined them to very different careers and
exacted of them very dissimilar artistic services.</p>

<p>At a concert given in Paris in 1846 appeared
a new prodigy, a boy pianist, «le petit Saint-Saëns,»
as the «Gazette Musicale» announced
him, who, only ten and a half years old, played
Händel, Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart, «without
notes, with no effort, giving his phrases
with clearness, elegance, and even expression
in the midst of the powerful effects of a numerous
orchestra using all its resources.» This,
the first public appearance of Saint-Saëns, was
by no means his first musical exploit. We read
that he began the study of the piano with his
great-aunt at the age of three, when already his
sense of tone was so keen that he would press
down with his left hand the slender fingers of
the right until they became strong enough to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
satisfy his exacting requirements; that at five
he composed little waltzes; that at ten he
played fugues by Bach, a concerto of Hummel,
and Beethoven's C-minor Concerto; and that
he could tell the notes of all the clock-chimes
in the house, and once remarked that a person
in the next room was «walking in trochees.»
By the time he was seventeen he had earned
wide reputation as a pianist, had taken prizes
for organ-playing at the conservatory, and had
written an ode for chorus, solo, and orchestra,
and a symphony. Thus early did he lay the
foundations of that skill which in the early seventies,
when at Wagner's house he played on
the piano the «Siegfried» score, won from von
Bülow the remark that, with the exception of
Wagner and Liszt, he was the greatest musician
living.</p>

<p>The surprising energy and versatility shown
at the opening of Saint-Saëns's career have
proved, in the course of time, to be the salient
traits of his typically Gallic nature. He is, to
a remarkable degree, the complete Frenchman.
He has all the intellectual vivacity, all the
nervous force, the quick wit and worldly polish,
even the physical swarthiness and the dry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
keenness of visage, that we associate with his
countrymen. M. Georges Servières, in his «La
Musique Française Moderne,» gives the following
excellent description: «Saint-Saëns is
of short stature. His head is extremely original,
the features characteristic; a great brow,
wide and open, where, between the eyebrows,
the energy and the tenacity of the man reveal
themselves; hair habitually cut short, and
brownish beard turning gray; a nose like an
eagle's beak, underlined by two deeply marked
wrinkles starting from the nostrils, eyes a little
prominent, very mobile, very expressive. The
familiars of his Mondays, those who knew the
artist before injured health and family sorrows
had darkened his character, remember that
there was about him then a keen animation,
a diabolic mischievousness, a railing irony, and
an agility in leaping in talk from one subject to
another with a sprightliness of fancy that
equaled the mobility of his features, which
were animated at one and the same moment by
the most contrary expressions; and I could
cite as instances of his gay humor many funny
anecdotes that he loved to tell, adjusting on his
nose the while, with both hands, in a way peculiar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
to him, his eye-glasses, behind which his
eyes sparkled with malice.» Some examples of
this railing irony of Saint-Saëns are preserved.
There is, for instance, a story of an ambitious
woman at one of his «Mondays,» who fairly
browbeat him into accompanying her two
daughters in a duet. After enduring as long
as he could the torture of their timeless and
tuneless performance, he turned to the mother
with, «<em>Which</em> of your daughters, madam, do
you wish me to accompany?» A man of his
wit naturally found himself at home in Paris
society, and counted among his friends for
years such people as the Princess Pauline Metternich,
Mme. Viardot-Garcia, and Meissonier,
Tourgenieff, and Dumas. A story told in the
«Figaro,» of how at Madame Garcia's, where
he often played both the organ and the piano,
he would pass from improvising «masterly
pages» in the contrapuntal style to waltzes for
the young people to dance by, illustrates in
little that peculiar combination of distinction
and gayety, characteristic of Paris, which is the
native air of Saint-Saëns.</p>

<p>But this adept metropolitan is also an inveterate
nomad. Not content with traveling all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
over Europe in his virtuoso tours, he has long
had the habit of wintering in outlandish places
like the Canary Islands. Often he leaves home
without announcing to any one his departure,
or even giving friends his addresses; sometimes
without knowing himself where he will
go. The spectacle of distant lands and alien
races has for him an inexhaustible fascination.
In writing of his experiences in England, where
he went in 1893 to receive the doctor's degree
from Cambridge, he dwells with gusto on
the procession of dignitaries, at the head of
which, he says, «marched the King of Bahonagar,
in a gold turban sparkling with fabulous
gems, a necklace of diamonds at his throat.»
«Dare I avow,» he adds, «that, as an enemy
of the banalities and the dull tones of our modern
garments, I was enchanted with the adventure?»
And in his charming little essay,
«Une Traversée de Bretagne,» the same enthusiasm
throws about his oboe-playing ship-captain
the glamour of romance. On his first trip
to the Canaries, made incognito, he is said to
have offered himself as a substitute to sing a
tenor part in «Le Trouvère,» and to have
come near appearing in this incongruous rôle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
When his grand opera, «Ascanio,» was produced
at Paris, he scandalized his friends and
the public by being absent from the first performance.
Diligent inquiry, and even the
efforts of the diplomatic agents of the Government,
failed to discover his whereabouts, and it
was actually rumored that he had died in Ceylon,
on his way to Japan. But all the while he
was happily basking in the sun at Palma, scribbling
verses. Finally his fondness for astronomy
is well known, and he is said to have a
private observatory in some «ultimate island.»
There is much about this picturesque Frenchman
that reminds one of the heroes of Jules
Verne's romances.</p>

<p>When he is at home, Saint-Saëns carries on
a many-sided activity of which composition is
hardly more than half. For one thing, he
is indefatigable in his efforts to improve
public taste. In 1864 he gave in a series of
concerts all the concertos of Mozart; in 1878,
such is the catholicity of his taste, he organized
concerts to produce Liszt's Symphonic Poems.
He has done much for musical bibliography
by his careful editions of Gluck, Rameau, and
others. In 1871 he took active measures to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
better the opportunities of young native composers.
At that time, as he puts it, «the
name of a composer at once French and living,
upon a programme, had the property to put
everybody to flight.» The great improvement
that has taken place since then is due largely to
him and his brother-workers of the National
Society of Music.</p>

<p>His two volumes of critical essays, «Harmonie
et Mélodie» and «Portraits et Souvenirs,»
are marked by soundness of principle, broad
eclecticism of taste, and a pungent, epigrammatic
style. In general temper he is classical
without being pedantic; that is to say, he has
no superstitious awe for rules, but a profound
reverence for law. The licenses of modern
technique and the mental vagueness of which
they are the reflection find in him a formidable
foe. The thrust he gives, in the preface of
«Portraits et Souvenirs,» to those amateurs
who are «annoyed or disdainful if the instruments
of the orchestra do not run in all directions,
like poisoned rats,» is typical of his attitude
and method. He is a master of innuendo
and delicate sarcasm, which he always employs,
however, to protect art against affectation and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
ignorance. In dealing with the theory that
music depends for its effect on physical pleasure,
he speaks derisively of the solo voice
which one can «savor at one's leisure, like a
sherbet.» He says of those orchestral conductors
and choirmasters who always complain
of difficulties that they «love above all their
little habits and the calm of their existence.»
Among these sparkling sentences one comes
frequently also upon pieces of wisdom, sometimes
expressed with rare dignity, as when
he writes, «There is in music something which
traverses the ear as a door, the reason as a vestibule,
and which goes yet further.» A writer
so highly gifted with both raillery and eloquence
might do mischief were he narrow or
intolerant. That Saint-Saëns is neither can be
seen from a mere enumeration of some of his
subjects, chosen almost at random: there are
essays on The Oratorios of Bach and Händel,
Jacques Offenbach, Liszt, Poetry and Music,
The Nibelungen Ring and the Performances
at Bayreuth, Don Giovanni, A Defense of
Opéra-Comique, The Multiple Resonance of
Bells, and The Wagnerian Illusion.</p>

<p>These titles indicate a wide enough range of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
interest, but Saint-Saëns is furthermore a writer
on subjects entirely unconnected with music.
His devotion to philosophy has prompted him
to publish a volume called «Problèmes et
Mystères;» an antiquarian interest has found
expression in his «Note sur les décors de Théâtre
dans l'antiquité romaine;» and he has
printed a volume of poems under the title
«Rimes familières.» Finally, a comedy in one
act called «La Crampe des écrivains» (a disease
from which he appears never to have suffered)
has been successfully produced at Paris.</p>

<p>As a composer, Saint-Saëns impresses the
student first of all by his excessive, his almost
inordinate, cleverness. It is not seemly for a
human being to be so clever; there is something
necromantic about it. Look at the opening
of the G-minor Piano Concerto and see
a modern Frenchman writing like the great
Bach. See, in the «Danse Macabre,» Berlioz
and Johann Strauss amalgamated. Listen to
the rich effects of tone in the 'Cello Sonata in
C minor. Study the thematic transformations
and the contrapuntal style of the Symphony in
the same key. Admire the lightness, the cobweb
iridescence, of the «Rouet d'Omphale.»
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
The author of these works is obviously a man
of great intellectual skill and versatility.</p>

<p>Looking more closely, one observes a duality
of style, for the moment puzzling, which
properly understood only emphasizes the peculiarity
of his artistic impulse. His compositions
are of two well-marked varieties which at
first seem to have little in common. To begin
with, all those cast in the conventional symphonic
mold&mdash;the three symphonies, the eight
concertos, three for violin and five for piano,
and most of the chamber-music&mdash;are severely,
at times almost aridly, classical in conception
and execution. They are «absolute music» of
the most unequivocal sort. They depend for
their effect on clear form, well-calculated symmetry,
traditional though interesting melodic
and harmonic treatment; their themes are of the
family of Haydn and Mozart; their structure
is that perfected by Beethoven; their orchestration
is skillful but unobtrusive, a transparent
medium rather than a rich material garment.
In a word, they are very pure examples
in music of a type of art&mdash;the French classic
or pseudo-classic type&mdash;which gains little from
richness of material or variety of suggestion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
which depends for its appeal on clarity and
symmetry of form and on clean workmanship
in style. But, in addition to these conventional
works, Saint-Saëns has produced a whole museum
of exotics, in which his aim is to delineate
passions, peoples, and places. There are the
four Symphonic Poems, for example, the
«Rouet d'Omphale,» «Phaéton,» the «Danse
Macabre,» and «La Jeunesse d'Hercule,» in
which he assumes the rôle of story-teller. In
the «Nuit à Lisbonne,» the «Jota Aragonese,»
and the «Rapsodie d'Auvergne,» he makes a
tour in southern Europe; in the «Suite Algerienne»
he portrays the deserts about Algiers,
and in his opus 89 he gives us a fantasy of odd
rhythms and outlandish tonalities supposed to
introduce us to Africa. Nothing could seem,
at the first blush, more diametrically opposite
to the pseudo-classic works than these exotics,
which among their academic brothers recall the
King of Bahonagar at Cambridge. Yet both
kinds, after all, when one looks more closely,
are products of the widely questing intelligence,
whose interests are dramatic rather than personal.
They have this in common, that neither
is of primarily emotional origin, that both are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
expressions of a mind objective and alertly observant.
The difference between them is that
in the one case this observation takes for object
the purely musical world of tones, and in the
other nature's world of persons, nations, races,
and climates. But whether he is seeking a
piquant rhythm or a curious turn of harmony,
or sketching his impression of Spain or Egypt,
Saint-Saëns is always the onlooker, the man of
the world, never the mystic who contemplates
in his own heart the forces that underlie the
universe.</p>

<p>Strong testimony from the man himself to the
truth of this view is indirectly afforded by
his essay on Liszt, an essay which is furthermore
noteworthy as containing in half a dozen
sentences the essential truths of that vexed
question of programme-music. He is, to begin
with, as assertive as we should expect of the
necessity, in all music, of absolute beauty. «Is
the music itself,» he says, «good or bad? All
is there. Whether or no it has a programme,
it will not be, for that, better or worse.» Thus
far speaks the author of the symphonies, the
concertos, and the chamber-works. The composer
of the symphonic poems and the geographical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
pieces continues: «But how much
greater is the charm when to the purely musical
pleasure is added that of the imagination coursing
without hesitation over a determined path....
All the faculties of the soul are put in
play at once, and toward the same end. I can
see well what art gains from this, I cannot see
what it loses.» Here speaks, recognizably
enough, the Frenchman. In that phrase about
«the imagination coursing without hesitation
over a determined path» stands clearly revealed
the dramatic point of view characteristic of
French art, which is always devoted to the
spectacle of life rather than to the elemental
passions which underlie it. The satisfactions
Saint-Saëns finds in music are those of the formal
musical sense and of «the imagination coursing
a determined path;» of the emotional satisfaction
which music gives so generously he has
nothing to say. To take another instance, how
admirably logical and how adequate to the composition,
which for all its picturesque grace
leaves one cold, is the «programme» he appends
to the «Rouet d'Omphale.» «The subject
of this symphonic poem,» he writes, «is feminine
seduction, the triumph of weakness over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
strength. The spinning-wheel is but a pretext,
chosen solely with a view to the rhythm and the
general effect of the piece. Those interested in
the study of details will see at page 19, Hercules
groaning under the bonds he cannot break, and
at page 32 Omphale laughing at the vain efforts
of the hero.» Both programme and piece are
the creations of a keen intelligence which records
its observations with accuracy and skill,
but makes no personal revelation, cares not to
contemplate itself, and is moved by no deep
and perhaps vague, but nevertheless creative,
emotion.</p>

<p>Lack of emotion, then, is the serious defect
of this master. And in a musician it is in truth
serious. Emotion is the life blood of the musical
organism; without it all the members may
be shapely, well ordered, highly finished, but
all will be cold and lifeless. So it is with much
of this clever craftsman's work. Too often
there is graceful melody, arresting harmony,
ingenious rhythm, but none of the passion
needed to fuse and transfigure them. Impassioned
vocal utterance, the song element in
music, is seldom heard from Saint-Saëns. In
the classic works he manipulates, in the exotic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
pieces he depicts; nowhere does he speak. But
to speak, to voice deep feeling directly, though
with the restraint necessary to plastic beauty,
is the aim and the justification of music. Complex
as the art has become in our day, the
essence of it is still, as it ever must be, emotional
expression; and though modern composers
sing broader songs than the first musicians,
and sing them on instruments rather
than with the voice, they must equally sing,
and their song must proceed from their hearts
if it is to touch the hearts of others. Hence
Saint-Saëns, when compared with a man of passionate
earnestness like César Franck, or Schumann,
or Wagner, inevitably seems superficial.
Pieces like his B-minor Violin Concerto, with
its elaborate classical machinery, its well-planned
contrasts and brilliant effects, and the vast
Symphony in C-minor, in which the theme undergoes
such wonderfully skillful manipulation,
seem so little the expression of a personal impulse
that we catch ourselves wondering why
he wrote them. Elsewhere, to be sure, as in
the Andante of the 'Cello Sonata, his very virtuosity
achieves such noble effects that we forget
the hand-made quality of the work. But it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
is seldom indeed that, subordinating workmanship
entirely, he gives us a genuine song of
feeling, such as the second theme of the Finale
in this Sonata. The lift and impetus of this
beautiful theme emphasizes by contrast the
emotional emptiness of the ingenious web that
surrounds it.</p>

<p>While, however, we may with propriety recognize
the lack of personal ardor in Saint-Saëns
that reduces the song element in his music to a
minimum, it would be a sad mistake to exaggerate
the limitation or to forget that from another
and perhaps an equally valid point of
view he is a great musician. However he may
fall short as a melodist, he is a past-master of
rhythm and harmony, spheres in which feeling
counts for less, logic for more. His harmonic
style is eminently lucid. To him a chord is
part of an organism, not a bit of color or a
phase of feeling. A series of chords has for him
all the tendency, the direction, and the self-fulfillment
of a sentence of words; to omit or to
change one would be like striking out a predicate
or an object&mdash;the sentence would not
parse. He uses most those chords which
point in a definite direction, which carry in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
themselves, so to speak, the indication for their
fulfillment&mdash;the dominant and secondary sevenths,
and suspensions of triads. He avoids
the vague and the ambiguous. And although
he is a lover of novel harmonic effects, and an
ingenious inventor of them, the novelty is
always a new form, not a new formlessness.
His modulation, too, is of an extreme clarity:
he never falls into a new key, so to speak, as
Dvo&#345;ák does; he proceeds thither.</p>

<p>But even more striking than the clearness of
his harmony is the trenchant perspicuity of his
rhythm. The sense of rhythm is perhaps the
prime criterion of intellectuality in a composer.
For just as determinations of accent and measure,
such as occur in the dances of the most
primeval savages, were undoubtedly the earliest
means of formulating the cries and wails of emotion
which underlie all musical expression, so
throughout musical history rhythm has been
the chief formative or rationalizing agent, and a
vivid sense of it has always characterized the
more intellectual musicians. The dreamers and
the sentimentalists are never fastidious of accent;
it is the clear, active minds who delight
in precise meter. Quite inevitable to a man of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Saint-Saëns's temperament, then, is the instinct
for strong, various and subtle rhythms that his
compositions reveal at every page. One discerns
it in his fondness for pizzicato effects and for the
percussion instruments, both of which emphasize
the accent. And his devotion to the piano,
which he uses more in combination with other
instruments than almost any other composer, is
doubtless due to the fact that it compensates for
its lack of sustained tone by a special incisiveness
of attack. Another significant peculiarity is the
short groups of repeated notes that occur so
often in his writings as to be a mannerism.
They are found, for example, in the fourth of his
Variations on a Theme of Beethoven, opus 35,
in the «scherzando» section of «Africa,» at the
opening of the Trio, opus 92, in the accompaniment
of the well-known air from «Samson et
Dalila,» «Mon c&#339;ur s'ouvre à ta voix,» and in
the third of the Six Études, opus 52. The effect
of this device, which throws a strong emphasis
on the first of the reiterated notes, is a
peculiar rhythmic salience. Again, on the principle
that minor irregularities in a regular plan
bring out all the more clearly the larger orderliness,
Saint-Saëns loves to alternate groups of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
four notes with groups of three, or three with
two, and to displace his accent entirely by syncopation,
which, when properly handled, deepens
the ideal stress by setting the actual in competition
with it.</p>

<p>In all these and countless other ways are revealed
the accuracy and virtuosity of intellect
that distinguish this brilliant Frenchman. Clearness
of form is, on the whole, so much rarer in
modern music than wealth of meaning, that the
art in our day has peculiar need of such workers.
Their office is to make us remember, in
our welter of emotion, the perennial delightfulness
of order and control. They are the apologists
of reason, without which feeling, however
noble, must become futile, inarticulate. In their
precise, well-constructed works we find a relief
from the dissipating effects of mere passion.
We breathe there a serene, if a somewhat rarefied,
atmosphere. Of this classic lucidity Saint-Saëns
is a great master. However dry he may
sometimes be, he is never turgid; however superficial
his thought, it is never vague; he offers
us his artistic sweets never in the form of syrup&mdash;he
refines and crystallizes them. If, then, we
of a race emotionally profounder and mentally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
more diffuse find his music sometimes empty
for all its skill, we must not for that reason underrate
the service he does for music by insisting
on articulateness in feeling, logic in development,
and punctilious finesse in workmanship.</p>

<blockquote>


<p>B<small>IBLIOGRAPHICAL</small> N<small>OTE.</small><small>&mdash;Saint-Saëns's best orchestral works
are arranged not only for four hands, but for two players at two
pianos, a combination of which he is extremely fond. It is interesting
to play in this way the four symphonic poems, «La
Rouet d'Omphale,» «Phaéton,» the «Danse Macabre,» and
«La Jeunesse d'Hercule.» The five Piano Concertos are also
excellent. The symphonies are rather dry. Of the chamber-music,
the 'Cello Sonata, op. 32, and the Violin Sonatas, op.
75 and 102, are particularly good. The piano music is less
original, being for the most part pseudo-classic in conception
and style. Thus the Suite, op. 90, is like a suite of Bach's
with the sincerity taken out. On the whole the Six Études, op.
52, and the Album of six pieces, op. 72, are better worth study.
The former contains two able fugues, the latter an odd «Carillon»
in 7-4 time and an attractive «Valse.» There is charm
in «Les Cloches du Soir,» op. 85, and also in a well-known
melody, without opus-number, called «Le Cygne.» Saint-Saëns
has little power as a song-writer; those who wish to realize
this for themselves, may purchase the Schirmer Album of
fifteen of his songs. To his numerous operas no reference is
made in the present essay, the subject of which is his contribution
to pure music.</small></p>

CÉSAR FRANCK</p>
<hr class="style2"/>

<p>When we turn from the brilliant
Parisian we have been studying
to that obscure and saintly
man, César Franck, the only
French contemporary of Saint-Saëns
who is worthy to be ranked with him as a
great composer, we can hardly believe ourselves
in the same country or epoch. It is as if we
were suddenly transported from modern Paris
into some mediæval monastery, to which the
noise of the world never penetrates, where nothing
breaks the silence save the songs of worship
and the deep note of the organ. In the presence
of this devout mystic the sounds of cities
and peoples fade away, and we are alone with
the soul and God. We have passed from the
noonday glare of the intellect, in which objects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
stand forth sharp and hard, into the soft cathedral
twilight of religious emotion; and putting
aside our ordinary thoughts we commune for a
time with deeper intuitions. Or, again, it is
like closing a volume of Taine and taking up
Maeterlinck. From the streets and the drawing-room
we pass into the cloister, where dwell
no longer men and things, but all the intangible
presences of thought and feeling. We close
our eyes on the pageant of experience, to reopen
them in the dim inner light of introspection,
where, if we may believe the mystics, they will
behold a truer reality. The temperament of
Franck is thus at the opposite pole from that
prehensile Gallic temperament so well exemplified
in Saint-Saëns, and we should find the
juxtaposition of the two men as the greatest
French composers of their time highly perplexing
did we not remember that, in spite of his
almost lifelong residence in Paris, César Franck
was by birth and blood, like Maeterlinck, with
whom he has so much in common, a Belgian.
Exactly how much the peculiar characters of
these men were inherited from their race it is of
course impossible to say; but any one who has
seen the placid faces of the Belgian peasants,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
with their calm, almost bovine look of contentment,
must recognize there a trait that needs
only the power of articulation to produce a natural
religion of feeling, or mysticism, like that
of César Franck and Maeterlinck. It was the
same sort of self-sufficient serenity, the antithesis
of Saint-Saëns's busy worldliness, that
determined the course of Franck's life, so obscure,
so uneventful, so dominated by high
spiritual purpose.</p>

<p>César-Auguste Franck (it was an inapt name
for so pacific a being) was born in 1822, at
Liége, Belgium. There he made his first
musical studies, but went to Paris at fifteen
to study in the Conservatory. Though without
the precocity of «le petit Saint-Saëns,»
he must have been a solid musician at sixteen,
for in a test that took place in July, 1838,
he transposed a piece at sight down a third,
playing it «avec un brio remarquable,» and was
awarded the first grand prize of honor at his
graduation in 1842. Foregoing the career of a
concert pianist, which his father wished him to
pursue, «repudiating with horror and disgust,»
as one of his biographers has it, «the brilliant
noise-making that people long mistook for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
music,» he turned for a livelihood to that laborious
work of teaching which he pursued all
the rest of his life with patient fidelity.</p>

<p>He seems to have been an almost ideal
teacher, long-suffering with the dull pupils,
painstaking and generous with the able ones,
provoking enthusiasm in all by his contagious
love for art and his receptivity to ideas. In
a degree that is rare even among the best teachers,
he combined endurance and vivacity. Giving,
all his life, from eight to ten lessons a day,
many of them, even after he had made his reputation,
in girls' boarding-schools and <em>pensions</em>
of the usual wearisome sort, he yet retained
vitality to impart to the best minds of the present
generation of French composers. Though
after teaching all day, often not returning home
until supper-time, he would in the evening give
correspondence lessons to pupils in the provinces,
and though even the Sundays were filled
with his duties as organist and choirmaster, still
he often found time to assemble his favorite
pupils, and to discuss with them, as if with
perfect equals, their exercises and his own
works. One of these pupils, M. Vincent
d'Indy, has described how «père Franck,» as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
they called him, would play them his choral
compositions, singing all the vocal parts in «a
terrible voice;» and how he would sit at the
piano, fixing with troubled gaze some offending
passage in an exercise, murmuring anxiously,
«Je n'aime pas ... Je n'aime pas,» until perhaps
it grew to seem permissible, and with his
bright smile he could cry a «J'aime!» Thanks
to his earnest desire to appreciate whatever was
good, controlled as it was by a severely classical
taste, he could make his students good workmen
and stern critics without paralyzing their
individual genius. He was thorough without
being rigid, and respected learners as much as
he revered the masters. Naturally, the learners,
in their turn, felt for their «Pater seraphicus,»
as they named him, an almost filial affection.
Emmanuel Chabrier, speaking over Franck's
grave, in Montrouge Cemetery, voiced the feelings
of them all when he said that this was not
merely an admirable artist, but «the dear regretted
master, the most gentle, modest, and
wise. He was the model, he was the example.»</p>

<p>For thirty-two years, that is to say, from
1858 until his death, Franck was organist of
the Église Ste. Clotilde, where his playing must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
have been an endless inspiration to all who
heard him, though his modesty kept him personally
inconspicuous. One likes to think of
this quiet, devout musician, animated by the
purest religious enthusiasm, advancing year by
year in mastery of his art, producing without
ostentation works of a novel and radical beauty.
Few of his listeners could have conceived that
one so benignant and courteous, but so easily
forgotten, was making himself a force that
modern music could not forget. They, who
saw only the husk of the man, could not guess
what treasures of humanity and genius it concealed.
M. d'Indy well describes the two
aspects. «Any one,» he says, «who had encountered
this being in the street, with his coat
too large, his trousers too short, his grimacing
and preoccupied face framed in his somewhat
gray whiskers, would not have believed in the
transformation that took place when, at the
piano, he explained and commented on some
beautiful work of art, or when, at the organ, he
put forth his inspired improvisations. Then
the music enveloped him like an aureole; then
one could not fail to be struck by the conscious
will expressed in the mouth and chin, by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
almost superhuman knowledge in his glance;
then only would one observe the nearly perfect
likeness of his large forehead to that of Beethoven.»
And M. Derepas has the following
paragraph in the same tenor: «It was there,
before the keyboards, his agile and powerful
feet upon the pedals, that it was necessary to
see César Franck. His beautiful head with its
finely developed brow crowned with naturally
curling hair, his profound and contemplative
expression, his features marked without exaggeration,
his full, well-cut mouth breathing
health, ... all wearing the aureole of genius
and of faith&mdash;it was like a vision of another
age in strong contrast with the turbulences of
the day.» If one is sometimes sorry that
Franck had to spend so much time teaching,
one cannot, in the face of such descriptions as
these, regret the hours he passed in the Église
Ste. Clotilde. Its atmosphere was native to his
genius, which was not only religious, but even
ecclesiastical. In hearing his «musique cathédralesque,»
as Saint-Saëns well called it, one
can almost see the pillars and arches, the pure
candle-flames and the bowed peasants at prayer.</p>

<p>It was in the spare moments of this full life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
that Franck found time to write his extraordinary
music. Every morning, winter and summer,
rising at six, he set aside two hours for
what he expressively called «his own work.»
Then, after breakfast, came the day's teaching,
in the course of which he would jot down ideas
that occurred to him, recording perhaps eight
measures, and turning again to the pupil. In
the evenings, when there were not correspondence-lessons
to write, or rehearsals, he often got
out his manuscripts once more; and his short
summer vacations were given entirely to composition.
All the more remarkable is this indomitability
when we remember that he lacked
not only the stimulus of public success, but for
a long while even the impetus of having definitely
succeeded in his own eyes, so new were
his ideas and so difficult the technique they required.
Very few composers have matured so
late. Though he wrote in his youth some trios,
and later a Mass, his first really individual work,
«Ruth,» was written when he was nearly fifty;
«Les Éolides,» his earliest orchestral composition,
was produced in 1877, when he was fifty-five;
«Les Beatitudes,» in some respects his
masterpiece, was not finished until 1880, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
begun more than ten years before; and all his
most characteristic work in pure music, as, for
example, the Prelude, Choral, and Fugue and
the Prelude, Aria, and Finale for piano, the
three wonderful Chorals for organ, the Violin
Sonata, the Quartet, the Quintet, and the Symphony,
date from the last decade of his life. In
a day when every harmony-student itches to
give the world a symphony, it is hard to admire
too much the artistic self-respect that kept
Franck a nonentity for years, to make him at
last a master.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, of course, he had to endure neglect.
Probably most of his acquaintances shared
the impression put into words by a Paris publisher
to whom M. Servières offered an essay
about him. «Oh, monsieur,» cried this gentleman,
«I remember César Franck perfectly. A
man who was always in a hurry, always soberly
dressed in black, and who wore his trousers too
short!... Organist at Sainte Clotilde. It
seems that he was a great musician, little known
to the public.» Rather harder to explain is the
lack of appreciation which in 1880 led those in
power at the Conservatory, where Franck was
already organ professor, to give the chair of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
composition then left vacant, not to him, but to
Léo Delibes, the writer of ballet-music. But
perhaps the most pathetic result of the general
indifference to Franck was that his masterpiece
could never be given a complete performance
during his lifetime. «Les Beatitudes» was first
given entire in 1893, three years after his death.
When he received the Legion of Honor in
1886, he said sorrowfully to a friend, «Yes, my
friend, they honor me&mdash;as a Professor.» That
is the one repining word of his that is recorded.</p>

<p>It would, however, be a mistake to suppose
that Franck's fellow-men noticed nothing but
his short trousers, or that in his high artistic effort
he was entirely without sympathy. Few
men have been more fortunate in their friends.
The love and veneration of his many pupils,
and of such men as Chabrier, Pierné, and Fauré,
made an atmosphere in which his heart expanded
and his ambition grew. One of this group of
admirers tells how they would surround him on
his return to Paris in the autumn, to ask what
he had done, what he had to show. «Vous
verrez, repondait-il»&mdash;the French alone can
render the endearing vanity and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</i> of his
reply&mdash;«vous verrez, repondait-il en prenant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
un air mysterieux, vous verrez; je crois que
vous serez content....  J'ai beaucoup travaillé
et bien travaillé.» It was a similarly
frank and guileless self-satisfaction that made
him apparently unaware of the coldness of his
audiences, who were generally puzzled or bored.
Happy, as M. d'Indy records, in having given
his friends the pleasure of hearing him play his
own compositions, in spite of the scanty applause
he never failed to bow profoundly. Thus
untroubled by the indifference of the crowd,
surrounded by a few men who gave him their
warm and discriminating admiration, and inspired
by a genius peculiarly exalted and disinterested,
bent on beauty alone, and superior to
petty jealousies, César Franck lived his quiet,
fruitful, and happy life. He died at Paris in
1890. The last anecdote we have of him tells
of his finding strength, four days before his
death, to praise the «Samson et Dalila» of
Saint-Saëns, then running at the Théâtre Lyrique.
«I see him yet,» says M. Arthur Coquard,
«turning towards me his poor suffering
face to say vivaciously and even joyfully, in the
vibrant tones that his friends know, 'tres beau,
tres beau.'» The words, expressing that pure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
love of art which animated his whole career,
lodge in the mind of one who studies it, together
with those other words of his, which none ever
had a better right to use, «J'ai beaucoup travaillé
et bien travaillé.»</p>

<p>It has been necessary to dwell at some length
on Franck's life and character because they
throw so much light on his music. To an unusual
degree it is the expression of himself, full
of his peculiar contemplative emotion. The
harmonic background is rich, somber, and vague,
like the prevailing mood of a religious devotee;
from it constantly emerge phrases of song,
phrases of the most poignant aspiration, like
passions in a dream, voicing those intense yet
elusive feelings which irradiate none but introspective
minds. They are like the cries of human
lovers in a world of silence and mystery,
or, better, they are the cries of a finite soul that
yearns for God and finds him not. One feels
always in Franck's music the tragedy of the
finite and the infinite. Those groping, shifting
harmonies, above which the pathetic fragments
of melody constantly sound for a moment,
somehow irresistibly suggest the great unknown
universe in which men's little lives are acted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
All is vague save the momentary feature, and
that presses on towards a fulfillment that perpetually
eludes it. All shifts and passes, save
only that never-ceasing mood of aspiration, that
restless striving of the fragment for completion.
Spiritual unrest is the characteristic quality of
this music&mdash;the unrest of a spirit pure and
ardent but forever unsatisfied.</p>

<p>Now, it is perhaps not too fantastic to find in
the mingled vagueness and poignancy of this music
the proper artistic expression of mysticism.
So <em>must</em> a mystic express himself. For it is
characteristic of the mystical temperament to
yearn for ideal satisfactions, but to find none in
finite forms. Mysticism, in fact, is one of the
ways of solving, or perhaps we should say of
ignoring, that primal and protean mystery of
human life, the conflict between ideal needs and
actual facts. Realism meets it by denying the
needs and exalting the facts; idealism attempts
to mold the real into conformity with the ideal,
of course with very partial success. The mystic,
too earnest to follow the realistic method,
too impatient to endure the plodding progress
of idealism, cuts the Gordian knot by discarding
the actual altogether. He pronounces it too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
inelastic, too constricting, and dispenses with it.
He hugs the ideal to his heart, but can see no
virtue in the real. Actualities, objects, events,
and forms which to the idealist are precious if
only partial expressions of spiritual values, are
to him wholly recalcitrant, wholly external and
illusory. The really precious thing, he says, is
something transcendent, something remote,
something that cannot transpire in events or
body itself in forms, because it is infinite and complete,
while these are finite, broken, and limited.
Henri-Frédéric Amiel, a man peculiarly dominated
by this way of viewing things, wrote in
his Journal, «Nothing finite is true, is interesting,
is worthy to fix my attention. All that is
particular is exclusive, and all that is exclusive
repels me. There is nothing non-exclusive but
the All; my end is communion with Being
through the whole of Being.» Now, whatever
may be the merits of this point of view, it obviously
involves a certain degree of artistic failure.
The mystic cannot be entirely successful
in art. For art depends on organization in
definite forms, and the mystic rejects all particular
forms as finite. «Reality, the present, the
irreparable, the necessary,» writes Amiel, «repel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
and even terrify me.... The life of thought
alone seems to me to have enough elasticity
and immensity, to be free enough from the irreparable;
practical life makes me afraid.» Accordingly,
men of this temperament are defeated
in their search for beauty by an unconquerable
shyness of all its incarnations. They
fear that in defining their fancy they will vulgarize
it. It is their fate to long for an all-inclusive
form in a world where forms are mutually
exclusive, to strive to utter truth in one
great word, when even the shortest sentence
must occupy time. Amiel himself is a pathetic
example of the mystic's destiny in art. Haunted
all his life by the vision of infinite beauty, the
conception of absolute truth, he could never
bring himself to accept the limitations of all
human performance, and his talent was almost
as unproductive as it was exalted. He never
could embody his aspirations. Tantalizing him
with the suggestion of supernal beauties, they
resisted all his efforts to come up with and embrace
them, because he denied himself the use
of those definite forms in which alone, however
inadequately, ideals can be realized.</p>

<p>In many respects César Franck is the analogue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
in music of Amiel in literature. That
vague richness of his emotional tone, which
like a dark background of night is constantly
lighted up by meteoric outbursts of passion, is
strangely like the somber moralizings and speculations,
in the «Journal Intime,» among which
Amiel's cries of spiritual pain, doubt, and longing
stand out with such sudden, poignant pathos.
Franck has in common with Amiel the
mystic's longing for ideal satisfactions, and the
mystic's distrust of all finite means of attaining
them. He, too, is «afraid» of the forms of
practical life, of the conventional devices of musical
structure and the types evolved by tradition.
He avoids always the obvious, the natural
even, and gropes toward some unattainable
ideal of expression. So great is his distrust of
the understood, the accepted, the usual and intelligible,
that he is always leaving the beaten
track and roaming afield after some novel and
untamed beauty. It will be worth while to get
to closer quarters with this tendency, and to see
exactly how it operates.</p>

<p>It is hard to make those unacquainted with
musical technique understand how much of
fixity there is in the musical idiom, how definite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
are the types of musical form, how potent
the requisitions of musical syntax. Yet,
without a sense of this fixity in the material, it
is impossible to estimate justly those impulses
and motives which may lead a composer to violate
usages and to disappoint expectations. In
the matter of harmony, for instance, there are
certain types of procedure, certain progressions
and sequences of chords, that are as stable and
uniform as the types of animal or vegetable
form. A horse, a dog, or a man is not a more
definite organism than the two chords in the
«Amen» of a hymn tune. This group or
cluster of two chords, linked together by a
common tone held over from one to the other,
yet made distinct by progression of the other
voices, is typical of a kind of harmonic form
that long usage has established as part of our
mental furniture. We are used to thinking of
chords thus welded by a common tone, and we
demand this sort of coherence in our harmonic
progressions, just as we demand that a horse's
body shall be furnished with a horse's legs, or
that a transitive verb shall have an object. To
be sure, this particular sort of cluster, in which
both chords are, as we say, consonant, is somewhat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
less determinate than another sort which
we shall describe presently, because, since all the
tones of the first chord are equally important,
any one may be selected as the link, and there
will be consequently some latitude in the choice
of the second chord, which completes the group.
But within these limits this sort of harmonic
type is definite and fixed, and that it is deeply
ingrained in our mode of thought is proved by
our horror of «consecutive octaves» and
«fifths,» those bugbears of harmony students,
which are bad chiefly because they are not compatible
with the retention of a common linking tone
between the two members of the group.</p>

<p>Here we have, then, one of those fundamental
harmonic forms which are in music what
idioms or phrases are in language. It is striking
how sedulously César Franck, distrustful of
the definite, the conventional, avoids them.
Compared with the work of a keen rationalist
like Saint-Saëns, his music is curiously incoherent,
curiously loose-knit, groping, and indeterminate.
His pages are studded with departures
and evasions; he delights in going
some other way than we expect, or in writing
chords that do not give us even any basis of expectation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
Consecutive octaves and fifths, so
terrible to lovers of cogency and sequence, are
an especial feature of his harmony, giving it
that curious lapsing effect so characteristic and
indescribable. His entire tone-mass has a trick
of sliding bodily up or down, which disconcerts,
even while it fascinates, one who is accustomed
to harmonic stability. The student need only
play over the opening of the Symphony or the
first page of the String Quartet to feel that here
is a man who treats traditions debonairly, and
who thus suggests novel beauties without defining
them.</p>

<p>Equally irresponsible is he in his treatment
of another sort of harmonic form which is intrinsically
even more definite than the clusters
of consonant chords like the «Amen.» When
there is a dissonant tone in the first chord, a
tone which, having slight justification for being,
presses urgently toward a neighboring tone in
the next chord, into which it is said to «resolve,»
then the cluster, as a whole, is even
more determinate. The dissonance introduces
a tension that must be relieved in one definite
way. It involves its own resolution just as unstable
equilibrium in a body involves its falling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
in the direction of the greatest pull. The alien
tone in the chord is got rid of by the path of
least resistance; it is a foreign element that
must be discharged. So potent is this tendency
of dissonant tones to resolve that it is one of the
chief means of vitalizing the entire musical
fabric. Unless music constantly got out of
harmony with itself it would no more progress
than a man would walk unless before each step
he lost his balance. It would stagnate. Consider,
for example, the last phrase of that
highly vitalized tune, «The Man that Broke the
Bank at Monte Carlo.» No one could attribute
stagnation to this phrase, whatever other faults
he might find in it; and its impetus is largely
due to the vigor with which it lands on the dissonant
chord next before the last, and the consequent
pull of this chord into the last. Try to
conceive of ending without that last chord, that
resolution in which the foreign element is discharged
and all comes to rest. It is told of
Mendelssohn that he rushed down-stairs in his
night clothes early one morning to resolve a
dominant seventh chord (such as we have on
the syllable «Car») which some waggish friend
struck and left uncompleted. Mendelssohn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
was of course unusually sensitive to harmonic
law, but it is not too much to draw from this
incident the conclusion that a chord which can
get a man out of bed in the morning to resolve
it must pretty potently suggest resolution. Dissonant
chords, in fact, are anything but inert
elements in the chemistry of harmonic composition.
They have strong affinities and combine
powerfully.</p>

<p>Yet César Franck is inclined either to ignore
these tendencies or to shift them into unexpected
and circuitous channels. The dissonant
chords, though they occur often in his work,
seldom take their normal course. They are led
into new dissonances, diverted to alien keys,
subjected to ingenious modifications, and in all
ways wrested from the realm of the obvious.
Towards the end of the Introduction to the
first movement of the String Quartet, for instance,
the student will find dominant sevenths
most interestingly unfaithful to their family
tradition, and effecting modulation through distant
keys. Similar treatment will be found on
almost any page in this Quartet, in the Quintet,
the Symphony, and the piano works. Thus,
Franck not only goes counter to the less determinate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
harmonic types in which both chords
are consonant, but he loves to disappoint our
expectations when they are strongly established
by dissonances. Nothing is more characteristic
of him than the formal indefiniteness of his harmony.
Full as it is of delicious and unwonted
beauties, it lacks accurate organization, clarity
and solidity of chord sequence. It is a web of
shifting tones, without obvious interrelationship
and inevitable progression.</p>

<p>When we turn to Franck's treatment of
meter and rhythm, we get some new side-lights
on the way his mysticism affects his music. He
is, in the first place, noticeably lacking in that
vigor of pulse, that strong accentuation, which
is the delight of active temperaments. He
sings constantly, almost never dances. After a
while the intensity of the song-like phrases, so
packed with emotion, becomes cloying, and we
long for a little of the headlong, thoughtless
progress of Grieg and Dvo&#345;ák. We need the
relaxation of muscular activity. It would be a
relief to stop feeling for a moment and be
borne along on a wave of perfectly unemotional
«passage-work.» But Franck never relieves
himself and his hearer by passages of brisk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
motion in which the interest is entirely active;
he is, so to speak, a very sedentary composer.
And so the rare beauties that stud the page lose
something by being set so thickly. The richness
of Franck's emotional impulse is a disadvantage
to his metrical structure. The same thing,
again, is true of his rhythm or phraseology. We
saw in the Introduction how elementary metrical
groups&mdash;measures&mdash;were built up into phrases
and tunes, and how the strongest synthetic
minds got the greatest variety and breadth of
phrase. Now Franck's phrasing, like Grieg's,
is of the primitive kind that reveals lack of
mental concentration, inability to build up wide
and complex forms. Draw a line across his
staff at every breathing-point, and your lines
will fall pretty regularly after the measures
whose numbers are multiples of four. Try the
same thing with Beethoven, and there will be
no telling where the lines will come, so varied
is the phraseology. In comparison, Franck's
themes seem hardly more than bundles of
motifs, loosely tied together. And of course this
effect is unfortunately reinforced by the peculiarities
of his harmony. How could a theme
hold itself together in such a kaleidoscope?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
How could it sustain itself on such a tonal
quicksand? Thus his tunes, rich as they are
in single phrases of poignant beauty, seldom
develop much breadth. They start out well,
but soon lose themselves in the web or fall into
poorly welded segments. In the larger structural
arrangement of his material as well as in
his primary metrical order he falls short of the
perfect organization of more powerful minds.</p>

<p>Franck illustrates, then, in many ways, in his
erratic treatment of harmony, in his metrical
monotony, and in his «shortness of breath,»
the mystic's failure to master form. And yet,
so beautiful are his effects, so arresting is his
personality, one feels instinctively that there is
in him something which destructive criticism
cannot assail. The very inarticulateness of the
mystic is, in fact, a sort of eloquence, perhaps
all the more persuasive because it hints at
beauties rather than defines them. However
beyond his reach his aspirations may be, so
long as they are genuine and ardent he will
have his unique artistic message. His work
will gain a pathetic appeal from the very fact
that it suggests feelings it cannot embody, and
his inarticulateness may even open up ways to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
new modes of utterance by reminding men that
there are truths other than those their formulas
so smugly stereotype. Thus a writer like
Amiel, ineffective as he seems from one point
of view, is not without his liberalizing influence
in literature. In the same way, César Franck,
the mystic among musicians, thanks to his profound
insight and emotion, combined though
they be with the characteristic shortcomings of
the seer, will widen the scope of future musical
technique and expression.</p>

<p>One of the constant temptations
of the biographer is that of
seizing on some salient trait in
his subject, magnifying it beyond
all relation to others which supplement
or modify it, and portraying an eccentric
rather than a rounded personality, a monster
rather than a man. Human nature is complex,
many-sided, even self-contradictory to any
but the most penetrative view; and so slender
are the resources of literature for dealing with
such a paradox as a man, that writers, resorting
to simplification, sacrifice fullness to intelligibility.
In books Napoleon is apt to be denied
all scruples, Keats all virility, Marcus Aurelius
all engaging folly; the real men were probably
not so simple. It is certain, at any rate, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
Tschaïkowsky, the greatest of Russian musicians,
one of the two greatest of all composers
since Wagner, cannot have been the mere incarnation
of concentrated gloom that his critics
have drawn. Some worthier powers than that
of eloquent lamenting must have contributed to
mold him. He was not simply a sort of neurasthenic
Jeremiah with a faculty for orchestration.</p>

<p>It is only too easy and plausible, to be sure,
to label him with one of those insidiously
blighting epithets, «neurasthenic,» «decadent,»
or «morbid.» He was, in fact, of an unfortunate
heredity; his grandfather was epileptic,
and his own symptoms pointed to an inherited
nervous irritability. He was troubled more or
less, all his life, by sleeplessness, fatigue, depression;
and in his thirty-seventh year had a
complete nervous collapse. But to discredit a
man's insight by pointing out his physical misfortunes
is as misleading as it is unkind. The
fact that Schopenhauer, with whose temperament
Tschaïkowsky's had much in common,
had some insane and idiotic ancestors, and suffered
much from his own unusual sensitiveness,
does not in the least abate the truth of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
his philosophic teaching, though it may call attention
to its one-sidedness. And so with the
musician; knowledge of his personal twist
ought not to make us deaf to whatever is universal
in his utterance. We may remember
that he reports but one aspect of the truth;
but if he reports that truly, we may supply
the other, and need not carp at the way he got
his information. And indeed is it not, after
all, an artificial circumscription of life to ignore
its sadder verities, however moral Pharisees
may stigmatize the perception of them as «morbid»?
Has not disease, as well as health, its
relation to our fortunes? Is not man's weakness
an organic part of his strength, his fear of his
courage, his doubt of his faith? That mere
facile optimism which smiles blandly at all experience,
with unseeing eyes, is as partial and
false as the unrelieved pessimism into which the
contemplation of it sometimes drives the sensitive.
The world is no more all light than it is
all shadow. All human life, with its suffering
as well as its happiness, is one, and every sincere
human experience has its own weight. And so
Tschaïkowsky, in spite of grandfathers and symptoms,
has a right to be respectfully heard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>The tendency to depreciate men like Tschaïkowsky
and Schopenhauer generally rests on a
confusion between what may be called sentimental
and rational pessimism. The sentimental
pessimist, the weak malcontent, who sees everything
through the blue spectacles of egotism, or,
like the cuttlefish, muddies his world with a black
humor of his own, deserves indeed nothing better
than a shrug. Like all other forms of sentimentality,
his pessimism is based on selfishness.
It is an emanation, not an insight. It is that
form of colic, to use the figure of Thoreau,
which makes him discover that the world has
been eating green apples. Quite different from
such a sentimentalist, however, is the sensitive
man who feels impersonally the real evils of life.
Such a man's experience is viewed by him, not
as the end, but as the means, of insight.
His own pains, however keen, appear to
him but as symbols of the universal suffering
of humanity, and however much his view
may be subjectively jaundiced, it does not terminate
in, but only begins with, the petty self.
He is not a devotee of the luxury of woe. «A
very noble character,» says Schopenhauer, «we
always conceive with a certain tinge of melancholy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
in it&mdash;a melancholy that is anything but
a continual peevishness in view of the daily vexations
of life (for such peevishness is an ignoble
trait, and arouses suspicions of maliciousness),
but rather a melancholy that comes from an insight
into the vanity of all joys, and the sorrowfulness
of all living, not alone of one's own fortune.»
And Tschaïkowsky, in describing
Beethoven's Choral Symphony, writes, one can
see, from precisely the same standpoint: «Such
joy is not of this earth. It is something ideal
and unrealizable; it has nothing in common
with this life, but is only a momentary aspiration
of humanity towards the holiness which exists
only in the world of art and beauty; afterwards,
this vale of earth, with its endless sorrow, its
agony of doubt and unsatisfied hopes, seems still
more gloomy and without issue. In the Ninth
Symphony we hear the despairing cry of a great
genius who, having irrevocably lost faith in happiness,
escapes for a time into the world of unrealizable
hopes, into the realm of broken-winged
ideals.» Now undoubtedly these
passages, especially the latter, are guilty of false
emphasis; undoubtedly one can truly reply to
Tschaïkowsky that the ideal is necessarily fairer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
than reality, as the flower is fairer than the soil
from which it springs, that «this vale of earth» is
not «without issue,» however gloomy, since it
does in fact produce the ideal world of art and
beauty, and that it is precisely the glory of hopes
that they are unrealizable, and of happiness that
it exists only on a level higher than that of finite
life. But, however one-sided may be the opinions
expressed, the attitude of mind is free from
the taint of petty selfishness; it is frank, open-eyed,
and manly. Such utterances proceed only
from natures nobly human, however burdened
with a greater sensibility than is common among
men.</p>

<p>Of the extraordinary sensibility of Tschaïkowsky,
his emotional intensity and impetuosity,
which, discerning truly, critics have so often
falsely interpreted, there can be no doubt. He
was the subject and in some ways the victim, of
hereditary instability, a tendency, so to speak,
to go off at half-cock. In his life no trait comes
out more conspicuously, and its association
with his powerful intellect, with which it was
always at odds, goes far to explain the anomalies
and paradoxes of his music. We see it constantly
in his acts, where, if we always remember
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
that we are studying a great nature, which must
be analyzed respectfully and without vulgar
curiosity, we may learn much from observing it.</p>

<p>Peter Ilyitch Tschaïkowsky was born in a
small Russian town in 1840. As a very small
boy he showed his ardent patriotism by kissing
the map of Russia, in his Atlas, and spitting at
the rest of Europe. When his French nurse
remonstrated, he explained that he had been
careful to cover France with his hand. There
already is his temperament&mdash;passionate and
tender. The Tschaïkowsky family early moved
to St. Petersburg, where Peter at first entered
the School of Jurisprudence, and later obtained
a post in the Ministry of Justice. All through
his youth he was indolent, popular, fond of
society, a graceful amateur who played <em>salon</em>
pieces at evening parties. That his serious interest
in music was first aroused by his cousin's
showing him how to «modulate» is rather
amusing when we remember the virtuosity and
daring of his mature harmonic style. «My
cousin said it was possible to modulate from
one key to another,» he says, «without using
more than three chords. This excited my curiosity,
and to my astonishment I found that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
improvised whatever modulations I suggested,
even from quite extraneous keys.» In 1861 he
wrote to his sister that he was meditating a
musical career, but was still in doubt whether
he could pursue it successfully. «Perhaps
idleness may take possession of me, and I may
not persevere.» But a little later all doubts had
vanished, he had given up his official work,
withdrawn from society, and thrown himself
with characteristic ardor into his studies. He
now sometimes sat up all night working, and
Rubinstein, his composition teacher at the Conservatory,
tells how on one occasion he submitted
no less than two hundred variations on a
single theme. He made such good progress
that in 1866, a few years after his graduation,
he was appointed professor of harmony in the
Moscow Conservatory.</p>

<p>From about this time date his first important
compositions. «When first he came to live in
Moscow,» writes his friend M. Kashkin, «although
he was then six-and-twenty, he was still
inexperienced and young in many things, especially
in the material questions of life; but in
all that concerned his work he was already mature,
with a particularly elaborate method of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
work, in which all was foreseen with admirable
judgment, and manipulated with the exactitude
of the surgeon in operating.» M. Kashkin's
testimony is a valuable corrective to the widespread
impression that Tschaïkowsky composed
in a mad frenzy of passion. No good work,
in art any more than in science, is done without
that calm deliberation which his strong mental
grasp made possible to him. His early compositions
were for the most part operas, and, it
must be added, unsuccessful operas. «The
Voievoda,» written in 1866, did not satisfy him,
and he burned the score. «Undine,» composed
in 1870, was not accepted by the theatrical authorities,
who moreover mislaid the manuscript;
Tschaïkowsky, years later, recovered
and destroyed it. In 1873 «Snegourotchka,»
a ballet, in spite of some musical beauty, failed
for lack of dramatic interest. The success of
«Kouznetz Vakoula,» produced a year later,
was ephemeral. Thus it was not until «The
Oprichnik,» which still holds the stage in Russia,
was brought out, when Tschaïkowsky was
thirty-four, that he made a pronounced success.
The persistence with which he continued to
labor during these years seems to be overlooked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
by those who consider him a mere prophet of
lassitude and discouragement. Nor would
such a man have undertaken and discharged
the drudgery of journalistic criticism as did
Tschaïkowsky in the four years from 1872 to
1876, when he was writing critiques for the
Moscow papers. Whatever fluctuations of
mood he may have undergone in these early
years, and we may be sure they were many, his
outward life was an example of equability, diligence
and patience.</p>

<p>In 1877, however, there was some sort of
tragic happening. That it was somehow connected
with an unhappy marriage, that it resulted
in a complete nervous breakdown, these
things we know.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>
It is unnecessary to probe
for more specific details; it is enough to note
that for a long time he was broken and despairing,
that through all the rest of his life his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
mental temper, never bright, was shadowed
with a pathological gloom. He left the Conservatory
suddenly, and was abroad a year.
He wrote one of his friends, «On the whole,
I am robust; but as regards my soul, there is
a wound there that will never heal. I think I
am <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">homme fini</i>.... Something is broken in
me; my wings are cut and I shall never fly
very high again.» He says that had he remained
a day longer in Moscow he should
have drowned himself, and it is said that he did
go so far, in his terrible depression, as to stand
up to his chest in the river one frosty September
night, «in the hope of literally catching his
death of cold, and getting rid of his troubles
without scandal.»</p>

<p>But he took the better way; indeed, the best
years, the quietest and most fruitful years, of
his life were yet before him. As robust in character
as he was sensitive and impetuous in temperament,
he pulled himself together, and wrote
in the next year his masterly Fourth Symphony,
his best opera, «Eugene Oniegin,» said to be
the second most popular opera in Russia, and
many other strong works. He returned also,
in the fall of 1878, to his post at the Conservatory,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
but, by the generosity of an anonymous
lady,<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>
was soon enabled to give up teaching and
devote himself entirely to composition. From
this time on, except for a conducting tour
through western Europe in 1888, and one to
America a few years later, he stayed chiefly in
the country, in studious solitude. His mode of
life at Maidanova, a little village where in 1885
he took a house, has been described by M.
Kashkin, who often visited him. After working
all the morning, and taking a simple but
well-cooked dinner, Tschaïkowsky always went
for a long walk, no matter what the weather.
«Many of his works were planned and his
themes invented,» we are told, «in these long
rambles across country.» After tea he worked
again until supper-time, and after supper the
two friends, ordering a bottle of wine and dismissing
the servant, would devote themselves to
playing four-hand music. M. Kashkin tells
one or two interesting stories of Tschaïkowsky
at this period. His impulsiveness, it seems,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
took the form in money matters of a fairly reckless
generosity. So lavishly did he shower coppers
on all the peasant children in the neighborhood,
that he could not go for his walk
without being surrounded by them. In one
afternoon he is said to have dispensed fourteen
shillings of his own and all of M. Kashkin's
small change. A friend once asked him where
he «invested his capital.» Convulsed with
laughter, he answered that his last investment of
capital had been in a Moscow hotel, and that
where his next would be he did not know.</p>

<p>The events of his tour in 1888 he has himself
narrated with characteristic modesty and
charm, in a fragment of diary. One can read
between the lines that he was everywhere the
center of admiring interest, but with fine literary
instinct he constantly subordinates himself
to the people and events through which he
moved. How lovable are his vainly continued
efforts to enjoy the music of Brahms, his eagerness
to record the little kindnesses of his
friends, his dignified reticence about his enemies,
his hearty appreciation of work far inferior
to his own! «I trust,» he says, «that it
will not appear like self-glorification that my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
dithyramb in praise of Grieg precedes the statement
that our natures are closely allied. Speaking
of Grieg's high qualities, I do not at all
wish to impress my readers with the notion
that I am endowed with an equal share of them.
I leave it to others to decide how far I am
lacking in all that Grieg possesses in such
abundance.» This warm appreciation of others,
combined with so pathetic a lack of self-confidence
that on more than one occasion he
burned the score of a work which was coldly
received, was so extreme in Tschaïkowsky
that one of his friends pronounced him the
least conceited of composers. Like all sensitive
people, indeed, he was painfully conscious
of social bonds; what was due him from others,
and what in turn was due them from him&mdash;these
intangibles, so easily forgotten by most
men, were to him heavy realities. It is touching
to see how dependent he was on the friendliness
of the orchestra he was leading, and he
was so impressible by criticism that long after
his fame was established he could repeat word
for word Hanslick's and Cui's early attacks
upon him. On the other hand, M. Kashkin says
that when he was conducting the works of others
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
he was so sensible of his responsibility that his
face wore a look of physical pain. When he
was dying of cholera, in terrible agony, he
thanked all about his bedside for the consideration
they showed him, and his last remark reminds
one of Charles the Second's «I am afraid,
gentlemen, I am an unconscionable time a-dying.»
He turned to his nephews after an unusually
severe attack of nausea with the exclamation,
«What a state I am in! You will
have but little respect for your uncle when you
think of him in such a state as this!» He
died at St. Petersburg, in October, 1893.</p>

<p>By this time it will be clear enough that this
was no puling complainer, but a delicate, high
nature of great emotional intensity, subjected
to a cruel interaction of temperament and circumstances,
and yet capable of nobly constructive
artistic work. His life, candidly examined,
reveals modesty, dignity, elevation of ideal and
of character. Yet it does illustrate, too, in
many ways, that lack of emotional balance
which underlies the peculiar quality of his
music.</p>

<p>His mere method of approaching his art, in
the first place, is significant. All his early efforts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
as we have seen, were operas; he wrote
altogether ten operas, and the Pathetic Symphony
is the last fruit of a genius dramatic
rather than symphonic. At thirty Tschaïkowsky
was unable to read orchestral scores with
ease, and preferred to study the classics through
four-hand arrangements, while his distaste for
the purest form of music was so great that he
protested he could hardly keep awake through
the performance of the masterly A-minor Quartet
of Beethoven. This attitude toward the
string quartet, which is in music what engraving
or etching is in representative art, is very anomalous
in a young composer, and shows so disproportionate
an interest in the merely expressive
side of music that it is hard to understand
how Tschaïkowsky ever became so great a
plastic master as his last two symphonies, for
all their freight of passion, show him to be.</p>

<p>He never, in fact, wholly outgrew certain peculiarities
which are direct results of his emotional
instability, his slavery to mood. His
persistent use of minor keys, for example, is, as
the doctors say, symptomatic. The minor is
naturally the medium of vague, subjective
moods and fantasies, of aspiration, longing, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
doubt; it is the vehicle of morbidly self-bounded
thoughts, whose depressing gloom is
equalled only by their seductive and malign
beauty. Such thoughts we find too often in
Chopin, Grieg, and, it must be added, in
Tschaïkowsky. Of the first thirty songs he
wrote, seventeen are in the minor mode. Of
course too much should not be argued from a
detail of this sort, but the major system is so
naturally the medium of vigorously objective
thought that we instinctively suspect the health of
a mind which harps continually upon the minor.
By a somewhat similar tendency towards self-involution,
the natural result of intense emotionality,
Tschaïkowsky inclines to monotony
of rhythm; he gets hypnotized, as it were, by
the regular pulsation of some recurring meter,
and he continues it to the verge of trance. An
example is the long pedal-point on D, in the
curious 5-4 measure of the second movement of
the Pathetic Symphony. This is like the wailing
and rocking of the women of a savage tribe over
the death of a warrior; it is at once wild and
sinister. But perhaps the most striking evidence
of this servitude to passion we are trying
to trace in Tschaïkowsky is his constant use of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
climax. It seems to be quite impossible for
him to preserve a mean-tone; he is always lashing
himself into a fury, boiling up into a frenetic
fortissimo, after which he lapses into coma until
some phrase of melody or impulse of rhythm
jostles his imagination again, and he presses on
toward a new crisis. The effect of these cumulative
whirlwinds of passion is often tremendous,
is unique, indeed, in music; yet one
longs sometimes in the midst of them for a less
turbulent attitude, for the equable beauty of
Bach or Mozart. The atmosphere is surcharged.
One feels that this noble but willful
spirit has sat too long in the close chamber of
personal feeling, that one must throw wide the
windows and let in the fresh winds of general
human existence.</p>

<p>Yet, after all, the imperfections of Tschaïkowsky's
music are due rather to the overwhelming
richness of his emotions than to any
shortcomings of mind; his case is an artistic
embarrassment of riches, and his critic must
avoid the fallacy of supposing, because his constructive
power is sometimes inadequate, that it
is ever meager. On the contrary, he is a man
of great intellectual force. It is too bad to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
so busy with Tschaïkowsky the pessimist that
one forgets Tschaïkowsky the artist. His melodic
fertility alone is enough to rank him with
the great constructive musicians. His devotion
to Mozart, and to the Italian opera-writers,
was no accident; by the spontaneity and beauty
of his melodies he has «approved himself their
worthy brother.» Few more inspiring tunes
can be found anywhere than the opening theme
of his B-flat minor Piano Concerto, with its
splendid and tireless vigor, or the broad, constantly
unfolding cantilena of the second theme
in the Fifth Symphony. His pages are plentifully
scattered with phrases of rare grace, of a
fresh and original charm. His harmony, too,
for all its radicalism, is generally firm and well
controlled, and his rhythm, however monotonous
at times, is never vague. In polyphony
(the simultaneous progress of different melodies)
he is a powerful master, as any one may
see by examining, for example, the masterly
variations in his Orchestral Suite, opus 55.
He is probably, on the whole, a greater master
of general construction than any of his contemporaries
except Brahms.</p>

<p>It is evident, then, that this curiously paradoxical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
personality was gifted with an intellectual
strength that went far toward dominating
the turbulent passions which, on the whole, it
could not quite dominate. But one needs, after
all, no careful statistical proof of the rationality
of Tschaïkowsky's music. The fact that it
survives, that it is widely listened to and loved,
proves <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i> that, however tinged it may be
with personal melancholy, it is not ultimately
pessimistical or destructive in effect. For it is
the happy fortune of art that it cannot fully
voice the destructive forces of anarchy and despair.
Its nature precludes the possibility, for
anarchy is chaos, despair is confusion, and neither
can be the subject of that clearly organic order
which is art. The artist may, of course, express
sadness; his work, if it is to be comprehensively
human, must be reflective of the ebb as well as
the flow of vital power. But it cannot mirror
complete dejection, the absolute lapse of power;
for without power there is no organization, and
without organization there is no art. The melodic
invention, the harmonic grasp, the rhythmic
vigor, in a word the powerful musical articulation,
everywhere present in Tschaïkowsky's
best work, remove it far from the inarticulate
moanings of despair. Such faculties as his are
anything but disintegrating or decadent; however
much individual sadness may attend their
exercise, they are upbuilding and creative.
Tschaïkowsky commands our admiration more
than our pity because, in spite of the burdens of
his temperament and the misfortunes of his experience,
he contributed to beauty, and beauty
is the standing confutation of evil.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>B<small>IBLIOGRAPHICAL</small> N<small>OTE.</small>
<small>&mdash;Much of Tschaïkowsky's early
work was for piano, but most of his piano pieces are light if
not trivial in character. They are amusing to play over, but
do not fairly represent his genius. Seventeen of them are to be
had in an album in the Collection Litolff. The Sonata, op. 37,
on the other hand, in spite of its marked resemblance to Schumann's
F-sharp minor Sonata, is one of the finest of modern
sonatas for piano. The Concertos are masterly, but very difficult.
Most of the important orchestral works are arranged for
four hands. The most interesting are the Pathetic Symphony,
the Fifth Symphony, which should be equally well known, the
Orchestral Suites, particularly the third, op. 55, with its charming
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tema con Variazioni</i>, and the Overture, Romeo and Juliet.
Of the chamber-works, the third String Quartet, op. 30, and the
Trio, are especially good. Twenty-four of Tschaïkowsky's
songs are published in an album by Novello, Ewer &amp; Co., and
many separately by G. Schirmer and others.</small></p>

JOHANNES BRAHMS</p>
<hr class="style2"/>

<p>Of all the figures of modern music,
brilliant and varied as they are,
impressing one with the many-sidedness
and wide scope of the
art, there is perhaps only one, that
of Johannes Brahms, which conveys the sense of
satisfying poise, self-control and sanity. Others
excel him in particular qualities. Grieg is more
delicate and intimate, Dvo&#345;ák warmer and clearer
in color; Saint-Saëns is more meteoric, Franck
more recondite and subtle, and Tschaïkowsky
more impassioned; but Brahms alone has Homeric
simplicity, the primeval health of the well-balanced
man. He excels all his contemporaries
in soundness and universality. In an age when
many people are uncertain of themselves and the
world, victims of a pervasive unrest and disappointment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
it is solacing to find so heroic and
simple a soul, who finds life acceptable, meets
it genially, and utters his joy and his sorrow
with the old classic sincerity. He is not blighted
by any of the myriad forms of egotism,&mdash;by
sentimentality, by the itch to be effective at all
costs, or to be «original,» or to be Byronic or
romantic or unfathomable. He has no «message»
for an errant world; no anathema, either
profoundly gloomy or insolently clever, to hurl
at God. He has rather a deep and broad impersonal
love of life; universal joy is the sum and
substance of his expression.</p>

<p>It is hard to say whether the unique greatness
of Brahms depends more on this emotional
wholesomeness and simplicity or on the
intellectual breadth and synthetic power with
which it is combined. Probably the truth is
that true greatness requires the interaction
of the two. At any rate, Brahms is equally remarkable,
whether considered as a man or as a
musician, for both. In his personal character
frankness, modesty, simple and homely virtue
were combined with the widest sympathy, the
most far-ranging intelligence, extreme catholicity
and tolerance. In music he prized equally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
the simplest elements, like the old German folk-songs
and the Hungarian dances, and the most
complex artistic forms that are evolved from
them by creative genius. Like Bach and Beethoven,
he spanned the whole range of human
interests; deep feeling fills his music with primitive
expressiveness, and at the same time great
intellectual power gives it the utmost scope and
complexity. Lacking either trait he would not
have been himself, he could not have performed
his service to music.</p>

<p>There are many anecdotes illustrating the
simple, large traits of the man. His pleasures
were homely, his ambitions inward and vital.
He cared little for fame, and was annoyed by
the foolish adulation of the crowd. To a long
and flowery speech addressed to him on the presentation
of some sort of tribute he answered,
with admirable brevity and utter prose, «Thank
you very much.» Once when a party of his
friends were gathered together to sample a rare
old wine, somebody pompously announced,
«What Brahms is among the composers, this
Rauenthaler is among the wines.» «Ah,»
snapped out Brahms, «then let's have a bottle
of Bach now.» He often remarked that one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
could never hope to get upon the level of such
giants as Bach and Beethoven; one could only
work conscientiously in one's own field. He
had the disgust of shams that one expects in so
sincere a lover of the genuine, and the armor
of roughness and sarcasm with which he protected
himself against the pretentious was formidable.
When the University of Cambridge
offered him a degree, suggesting that he write a
new work for the occasion, he replied that if
any of his old works seemed good enough to
them he should be happy to receive the honor,
but that he was too busy to write a new one.
There was about him something shaggy, bear-like,
and one can imagine the foxes and weasels
scattering at his growl.</p>

<p>But for everything fresh and genuine Brahms
had the heartiest love. He is one of the innumerable
army of great men of whom biography
loves to relate that they always carried
candy in their pockets for the children, and
a lady described in a letter how she had seen him
on the hotel piazza, on all-fours, clambered over
by young playmates. He was on cordial terms
with waiters and servants, and told Mr. Henschel
with emotion the story of a serving-maid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
who lost her position in order to shield a careless
postman, who, being married, could not afford to
lose his. Another pretty story, showing at
once his modesty and his catholicity of taste, recounts
how all the musical friends of the wife of
Johann Strauss, the great waltz composer, were
writing their names, with phrases from their
works, on her fan. When it was his turn, the
composer of the German Requiem wrote the
opening phrase of the «Blue Danube» waltz,
and underneath it the words, «Not, I regret to
say, by your devoted friend, Johannes Brahms.»
Thus wholesome and unaffected was the character
of this great man.</p>

<p>Outwardly, Brahms's life was uneventful. His
father was a contrabass-player in the theatre orchestra
of Hamburg. In him his son's positiveness
of character seems to have been foreshadowed,
for we learn that when the conductor
once directed him not to play so loud, he replied
with dignity: «Herr Capellmeister, this
is my contrabass, I want you to understand,
and I shall play on it as loud as I please.»
Brahms was born at Hamburg in 1833, and from
his earliest years was trained for music as a matter
of course. His early acquaintance with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
best works was of incalculable value to him.
Mr. Hadow points out that the eclecticism and
solidity of his style was doubtless largely due to
the study of Bach and Beethoven that he made
in youth under Marxsen. He had the advantage,
too, of early practical experience. When
he was only twenty he made a concert tour with
Reményi, the Hungarian violinist, during which
he gained much training and confidence. A
feat he performed during this trip showed even
more virtuosity than that of «le petit Saint-Saëns»
already recorded. Having to play the
Kreutzer Sonata on a piano too low in pitch
to suit Reményi, who disliked to tune down his
violin, he transposed it up a semi-tone, and
though playing without notes, performed it accurately
and with spirit. To this feat, which
aroused the admiration of Joachim, Brahms
owed his acquaintance with the great violinist,
and through him with Liszt and Schumann.
His experience with the former, then in the
height of his fame, was unfortunate, but characteristic.
Brahms, who was worn out with travel,
fell asleep during one of the most moving parts
of Liszt's Sonata, which the great virtuoso was
so condescending as to play. Though Brahms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
was only a boy at the time, he was evidently,
even then, undazzled by worldly glory.</p>

<p>His meeting with Schumann was much more
happy; indeed, it was one of the important
events of his life. Probably no young composer
ever received such a hearty welcome into
the musical world as Schumann extended to
Brahms in his famous article, «New Paths.»
«In sure and unfaltering accents,» writes Mr.
Hadow, «he proclaimed the advent of a genius
in whom the spirit of the age should find its
consummation and its fulfilment; a master by
whose teaching the broken phrases should grow
articulate, and the vague aspirations gather into
form and substance. The five-and-twenty years
of wandering were over; at last a leader had
arisen who should direct the art into 'new
paths,' and carry it a stage nearer to its appointed
place.» It is not surprising that Schumann,
whose generous enthusiasm often led him
to praise worthless work, should have received
the early compositions of Brahms so cordially.
Their qualities were such as to affect profoundly
the great romanticist. Although the essential
character of his mature works is their classical
balance and restraint, these first compositions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
show an exuberance, a wayward fertility of invention,
thoroughly romantic. His first ten
opuses, or at any rate the three sonatas and the
four ballades for piano, are frequently turgid in
emotion, and ill-considered in form. The massive
vigor of his later work here appears in the
guise of a cyclopean violence. It is small wonder
that Schumann, dazzled, delighted, overwhelmed,
gave his ardent support to the young
man. Brahms now found himself suddenly famous.
He was discussed everywhere, his pieces
were readily accepted by publishers, and his new
compositions were awaited with interest.</p>

<p>But fortunate as all this was for Brahms, it
might easily, but for his own good sense and
self-control, have turned out the most unfortunate
thing that could happen to him. For consider
his position. He was a brilliant young
composer who had been publicly proclaimed by
one of the highest musical authorities. He was
expected to go on producing works; he was
almost under obligation to justify his impressive
introduction. Not to do so would be much
worse than to remain a nonentity; it would be
to become one. And he had meanwhile every
internal reason for meeting people's demands.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
He was full of ideas, conscious of power, under
inward as well as outward compulsion to express
himself. Yet for all that, he was in reality
immature, unformed, and callow. His work,
for all its brilliancy, was whimsical and subjective.
If he had followed out the path he was
on, as any contemporary observer would have
expected, he would have become one of the
most radical of romanticists. At thirty he would
have been a bright star in the musical firmament,
at forty he would have been one of several
bright stars, at fifty he would have been
clever and disappointed. It required rare insight
in so young a man, suddenly successful, to
realize the danger, rare courage to avert it.
When we consider the temptation it must have
been to him to continue these easy triumphs,
when we imagine the inward enthusiasm of creation
with which he must have been on fire, we are
ready to appreciate the next event of the drama.</p>

<p>That event was withdrawal from the musical
world and the initiation of a long course of the
severest study. When he was a little over
twenty-one, Brahms imposed upon himself this
arduous training, and commanded himself to
forego for a while the eloquent but ill-controlled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
expression hitherto his, in order to acquire a
broader, firmer, purer, and stronger style. For
four or five years, to borrow Stevenson's expression,
he «played the sedulous ape» to Bach
and Beethoven, and in a minor degree to
Haydn and Mozart. The complex harmonies
of his first period gave place to simple, strong
successions of triads; for an emotional and often
vague type of melody he substituted clearly
crystallized, fluent, and gracious phrases, frequently
devoid of any particular expression;
the whimsical rhythms of the piano sonatas were
followed by the square-cut sections of the Serenade,
opus 11. Of course the immediate effect
of all this was a great sacrifice of what is called
originality; had Brahms not had complete faith
in the vitality of his genius he could not have
surrendered so much of immediate attainment
for the sake of an ultimately greater mastery.
It is a profound lesson in the ethics of art that
a man who could write the fourth of the Ballades,
opus 10, should have been willing to follow it
up with this Serenade, opus 11. Yet Brahms
knew what he was about, and his first large
work, the Piano Concerto, opus 15, shows his
individuality of expression entirely regained,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
and now with immensely increased power and
resource.</p>

<p>Nothing could exhibit better than this dissatisfaction
with his early work and withdrawal
from the world for study, that intellectual
breadth which we have noted as characteristic
of Brahms. He was not a man who could be
content with a narrow personal expression. No
subjective heaven could satisfy him. His wide
human sympathy and his passion for artistic
perfection alike, compelled him to study unremittingly,
to widen his ideals as his powers increased.
No fate could seem to him so horrible
as that «setting» of the mind which is
the æsthetic analogue of selfishness. Originality,
which so often degenerates into idiosyncrasy,
was much less an object to him than universality,
which is after all the best means of
being serviceably original. Dr. Deiters, in his
reminiscences, after describing this period of
study, continues: «Henceforth we find him
striving after moderation, endeavoring to place
himself more in touch with the public, and to
conquer all subjectiveness. To arrive at perspicuity
and precision of invention, clear design
and form, careful elaboration and accurate balancing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
of effect, now became with him essential
and established principles.»</p>

<p>From this time until the end of his life, in
fact, a period of only a little less than forty
years&mdash;he died in 1897&mdash;Brahms never departed
from the modes of work and the ideals
of attainment he had now set himself. He
labored indefatigably, but with no haste or
impatience. He was too painstaking and conscientious
a workman to botch his products by
hurrying them. He thus described to his friend,
Mr. Henschel, his method of composing:
«There is no real <em>creating</em> without hard work.
That which you would call invention, that is to
say, a thought, is simply an inspiration from
above, for which I am not responsible, which is
no merit of mine. Yes, it is a present, a gift,
which I ought even to despise until I have made
it my own by right of hard work. And there
need be no hurry about that either. It is as
with the seed corn: it germinates unconsciously
and in spite of ourselves. When I, for instance,
have found the first phrase of a song, I might
shut the book there and then, go for a walk, do
some other work, and perhaps not think of it
again for months. Nothing, however, is lost.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
If afterward I approach the subject again, it is
sure to have taken shape; I can now really begin
to work at it.» Another inkling of the severity
of his standard we have in a remark he
made after pointing out certain imperfections in
a song of Mr. Henschel's. «Whether it is
beautiful also,» he said, «is an entirely different
matter; but perfect it must be.» With such a
standard, we need not be surprised that he imposed
so severe a training upon himself at
twenty-one, or that he continued all his life the
practice of writing each day a contrapuntal exercise,
or that he wrought for ten years over his
first symphony, that Titanic work. Thus laboring
always with the same calm persistence,
returning upon his ideas until he could present
them with perfect clarity, caring little for the indifference
or the applause of the public, but
much for the approval of his own fastidious taste,
he produced year by year an astonishing series
of masterpieces. No one has better described
the kind of work that made Brahms great than
Matthew Arnold in those lines about labor</p>

<div class="indentp">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse ileft4">«which in lasting fruit outgrows</div>
<div class="verse">Far noisier schemes; accomplished in repose;</div>
<div class="verse">Too great for haste, too high for rivalry.»</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>A just conception of this broad scheme of
Brahms's ideal and of his thoroughness in working
it out is necessary, we must insist, not only
to appreciation of the man himself, but to any
true understanding of his relation and service to
music. Brahms was enabled, by the tireless
training to which he subjected his fertile and
many-sided genius, to couch romantic feeling
in classic form. In order to grasp the full significance
of such a work, it is necessary to bear
in mind those fundamental principles of musical
effect and facts of musical history which have
been presented in the Introduction. Music
has resulted from the gradual formal definition,
by time and pitch relations, of those vague gestures
and utterances by which men expressed
their primitive feelings. It has been, in a word,
the product of two human instincts, neither of
which alone would have sufficed to produce it&mdash;the
instinct for expression and the instinct
for beauty. But these instincts have not worked
with precisely equal efficacy at all times. In
fact, so limited is human attention, so few
things can men attend to at once, every great
development of expression has generally disturbed
the equilibrium requisite to beauty, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
every great advance in beauty has generally, for
the time being, restrained the eloquence of expression.
Musical history is a series of reactions
between man's primal emotional impulse
and his desire for intelligibility. First, urgency
of feeling drives him to a formless cry; then
the wish to be understood and the love of
beauty induce him to formulate this cry; finally,
as soon as the formula is felt to be inadequate
to further expression, it is discarded in
favor of one more elastic and complex. The
conventions that are helpful at one stage prove
hindrances in the next. The same forms that
subserve growth up to a certain point, beyond
that point hamper it. Accordingly, in the history
of music, formulation has always been followed
by relaxation of the formulæ to admit of
new expression; and when new expression has
been thus evolved, a new and more complex
form has had to be worked out to regulate and
fix it.</p>

<p>Such a period of relaxation was that which
intervened between Beethoven and Brahms.
The romanticists, headed by Schumann,
seized upon the possibilities of poignant expression
that they were quick to recognize in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
heritage from Beethoven, and developed an extraordinarily
mobile and eloquent instrument for
voicing personal emotion. At the same time
they inevitably lost the perfect control of form,
the transparent lucidity of structure, that had
characterized Beethoven. In some respects
more moving, they were on the whole less intelligible.
They were enriching their art, and
must leave the perfect subordination of the new
material to their successors. It is most interesting
to trace the analogy between this development
of musical expression and the growth
of emotional life in the individual, and to observe
how in both the period of experience, in
which emotion is felt in all its immediate stress,
inhibiting all else and being therefore conceived
in no relations, but merely as a single and ultimate
fact, is followed by the period of meditation
and self-inspection, when the whole emotional
life is grouped into order, and the man
learns to see the significance and the spiritual
value of his feelings. With the romanticists music
necessarily became more and more the medium
of personal passion, less and less the revealer
of universal order.</p>

<p>Browning, himself a romanticist through and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
through, has summed up the spirit of romanticism
in a single stanza of his «Old Pictures
in Florence»:</p>

<div class="indentp">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">«On which I conclude, that the early painters,</div>
<div class="verse ileft2">To cries of 'Greek art and what more wish you?'</div>
<div class="verse">Replied, 'To become now self-acquainters,</div>
<div class="verse ileft2">And paint man, man, whatever the issue!</div>
<div class="verse">Make new hopes shine through the flesh they fray,</div>
<div class="verse ileft2">New fears aggrandize the rags and tatters:</div>
<div class="verse">To bring the invisible full into play!</div>
<div class="verse ileft2">Let the visible go to the dogs&mdash;what matters?'»</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The individualism, the subjectivity, the mystical
distrust of definite forms, so stirringly championed
in these lines, are vital principles in the
work of all the composers of the generation after
Beethoven. Thus in Schumann's music, for
example, the generality of the emotional burden
of classical music is changed to something far
more individual and introspective. Expression
is more tinged by temperament; the work of art
exhales a personal fragrance. Schumann tells
us not merely of love, longing, and passion, but
of Robert Schumann's love, longing, and passion.
His work, for all its beauty, is much less
inclusive and complete than the classical masterpieces.
In the same way Chopin filled his nocturnes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
and preludes with the lovely but often
unhealthy poetry of the isolated dreamer, and
Wagner, separating the passion of love from the
other interests of the heart, and thus throwing
out of balance the spiritual economy, sacrificed
as much in health as he gained in potency.
And of the men we have been studying, Grieg,
Franck, and Tschaïkowsky also illustrate in various
ways the tendency to «paint man, man,
whatever the issue,» to let the «flesh be frayed»
and the «visible go to the dogs.» It is hardly
necessary to say that all these men have their
legitimate place. Their message of passion and
unrest, already audible in Beethoven, was the
inevitable and indispensable expression of one
of those self-conscious phases in man's growth
when he freshly realizes his finitude. Their utterances
make a deeply pathetic appeal to us,
because they reveal all the terrible sadness of
personal life which as yet finds no resting-place
in the universal. Aspiration and disappointment,
bitter grief and blind pain, speak in their
fragmentary loveliness. The romanticists will
never want for our love, since they interpret to
us a part of our own experience.</p>

<p>But, as we have said, after man suffers emotion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
he reflects upon it; after he feels the parts
he learns the whole; after musicians have developed
new capabilities of expression they proceed
to subordinate them to plastic beauty.
Adjustment follows discovery, and the romantic
takes on classical perfection. The chaos of one
age is thus the order of the next; and after
Schumann and his fellows had enriched the
world with their beautiful but fragmentary and
wayward feelings, it remained for Brahms to
essay a further conquest; to commence at least
(and perhaps he has not done more) the task
of making these new feelings more intelligible,
of clarifying their turgidity, of subordinating
their conflicts in a more complex harmony.
Or, to state his function in more specifically
musical terms, he had to discover how rugged
melodic outlines, bold harmonic progressions,
and the large-spanned phrases of modern musical
thought could be organized and brought
into that unity in variety which is beauty.</p>

<p>We are now in a position to grasp the full
significance of that severe training to which
Brahms subjected himself in his youth. Without
it he would have gone on doing brilliant
work of the romantic order, like his first compositions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
but he would never have attained the
grasp and self-control that raised him above all
his contemporaries and that made possible his
peculiar service to music. That period of training
was the artistic counterpart of what many
men undergo when they discover how many
sacrifices and how long a labor are necessary to
him who would find a spiritual dwelling-place
on earth. Many pleasures must be renounced
before happiness will abide; evil and suffering
are opaque save to the steadfast eye. So, in
music, effects and eloquences and crises must
be the handmaids of orderly beauty, and tones
are stubborn material until one has learned by
hard work to make them transmit thoughts.
Technic is in the musician what character is
in the man. It is the power to stamp matter
with spirit. Brahms's long apprenticeship was
therefore needed in the first place to make him
master of his materials; in the second place to
teach him the deeper lesson that the part must
be subordinated to the whole, or, in musical
language, expression to beauty.</p>

<p>He achieved this subordination, however, not
by the negative process of suppression, but by
conquest and co-ordination. In his music
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
emotion is not excluded, it is regulated; his
work is not a reversion to an earlier and simpler
type, it is the gathering and fusing together of
fragmentary new elements, resulting in a more
complex organism. Thus it is a very superficial
view to say that he «went back» to
Beethoven. He drew guidance from the same
natural laws that had guided Beethoven, but he
applied these laws to a material of novel thought
and emotion that had come into being after
Beethoven. Had he repudiated the new material,
even for the reason that he considered it
incapable of organization, he would have been
a pedant, which is to say a musical Pharisee.
One masters by recognizing and using, not by
repudiating. And just as a wise man will not
become ascetical merely because his passions
give him trouble, but will study to find out
their true relation to <em>him</em> and then keep them
in it, so Brahms recognized the wayward beauties
of romanticism, and studied how to make
them ancillary to that order and fair proportion
which is the soul of music.</p>

<p>To this great artistic service he was fitted by
both the qualities which have been pointed out
above as co-operating to form his unique nature.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
His deep and simple human feeling, which put
him in sympathy with the aims of the romanticists
and enabled him to grasp their meaning,
would not have sufficed alone; but fortunately
it was associated with an almost unprecedented
scope of intellect and power of synthesis.
Brahms's assimilative faculty was enormous.
Like a fine tree that draws the materials of its
beauty through a thousand roots that reach into
distant pockets of earth, he gathered the materials
of his perfectly unified and transparent
style from all sorts of forgotten nooks and
crannies of mediæval music. Spitta remarks
his use of the old Dorian and Phrygian modes;
of complex rhythms that had long fallen into
disuse; of those means of thematic development,
such as augmentation and diminution,
which flourished in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries; of «the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">basso ostinato</i> with the styles
pertaining to it&mdash;the Passacaglia and the Ciaconna;»
and of the old style of variations, in
which the bass rather than the melody is the
feature retained. «No musician,» Spitta concludes,
«was more well read in his art or more
constantly disposed to appropriate all that was
new, especially all newly discovered treasures of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
the past. His passion for learning wandered,
indeed, into every field, and resulted in a rich
and most original culture of mind, for his
knowledge was not mere acquirement, but became
a living and fruitful thing.»</p>

<p>The vitality of his relation with the past is
nowhere more strikingly shown than in his indebtedness
to the two greatest masters of pure
music, Bach and Beethoven. He has gathered
up the threads of their dissimilar styles, and
knitted them into one solid fabric. The great
glory of Bach, as is well-known, was his wonderful
polyphony. In his work every voice is
a melody, everything sings, there is no dead
wood, no flaccid filling. Beethoven, on the
other hand, turning to new problems, to problems
of structure which demanded a new sort
of control of key-relationship and the thematic
development of single «subjects» or tunes,
necessarily paid less attention to the subordinate
voices. His style is homophonic or one-voiced
rather than polyphonic. The interest centres
in one melody and its evolutions, while the
others fall into the subordinate position of accompaniment.
But Brahms, retaining and extending
the complexity of structure, the architectural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
variety and solidity, that was Beethoven's great
achievement, has succeeded in giving new
melodic life also to the inner parts, so that the
significance and interest of the whole web remind
one of Bach. His skill as a contrapuntist
is as notable as his command of structure.
Thanks to his wonderful power of assimilating
methods, of adapting them to the needs of his
own expression, so that he remains personal
and genuine while becoming universal in scope,
he is the true heir and comrade of Bach and
Beethoven.</p>

<p>It was, perhaps, inevitable that in his great
work of synthesis and formulation he should
sometimes be led into dry formalism. One who
concerns himself so indefatigably with the technic
of construction naturally comes to take a
keen joy in the exercise of his skill; and this
may easily result, when thought halts, in the
fabrication of ingenuities and Chinese puzzles.
Some pages of Brahms consist of infinitely
dexterous manipulations of meaningless phrases.
And though one must guard against assuming
that he is dry whenever one does not readily
follow him, it certainly must be confessed that
sometimes he seems to write merely for the sake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
of writing. This occasional over-intellectualism,
moreover, is unfortunately aggravated by a lack
of feeling for the purely sensuous side of music,
for clear, rich tone-combination, to which
Brahms must plead guilty. His orchestra is
often muddy and hoarse, his piano style often
shows neglect of the necessities of sonority and
clearness. Dr. William Mason testifies that
his touch was hard and unsympathetic, and it is
rather significant of insensibility or indifference
to tone color that his Piano Quintet was at first
written for strings alone, and that the Variations
on a Theme of Haydn exist in two forms,
one for orchestra and the other for two pianos,
neither of which is announced as the original
version. There is danger of exaggerating the
importance of such facts, however. Austere and
somber as Brahms's scoring generally is, it may
be held that so it should be to be in keeping
with the musical conception. And if his piano
style is novel it is not really unidiomatic or without
its own peculiar effects.</p>

<p>However extreme we may consider the weakness
of sensuous perception, which on the whole
cannot be denied in Brahms, it is the only serious
flaw in a man equally great on the emotional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
and the intellectual sides. Very remarkable
is the richness and at the same time the
balance of Brahms's nature. He recognized
early in life that feelings were valuable, not for
their mere poignancy, but by their effect on the
central spirit; and he labored incessantly to express
them with eloquence and yet with control.
It is only little men who estimate an emotion
by its intensity, and who try to express everything,
the hysterical as well as the deliberate,
the trivial and mischievous as well as the
weighty and the inspiring. They imagine that
success in art depends on the number of things
they say, that to voice a temperament is to build
a character. But great men, though they reject
no sincere human feeling, care more to give the
right impression than to be exhaustive; and the
greatest feel instinctively that the last word of
their art must be constructive, positive, upbuilding.
Thoreau remarks that the singer can
easily move us to tears or laughter, but asks,
«Where is he who can communicate a pure
morning joy?» It is Brahms's unique greatness
among modern composers that he was able
to infuse his music, in which all personal passion
is made accessory to beauty, with this «pure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
morning joy.» His aim in writing is something
more than to chronicle subjective feelings,
however various or intense. And that is why
we have to consider him the greatest composer
of his time, even though in particular departments
he must take a place second to others.
Steadily avoiding all fragmentary, wayward, and
distortive expression, using always his consummate
mastery of his medium and his synthetic
power of thought to subserve a large and universal
utterance, he points the way for a healthy
and fruitful development of music in the future.</p>

<p>B<small>IBLIOGRAPHICAL</small> N<small>OTE.</small>
<small>&mdash;Of particular works of Brahms
that the reader might wish to study, here are some of the most
characteristic and well known. Piano pieces: The Waltzes, op.
39; the Clavierstücke, op. 76, particularly No. 2; the two
Rhapsodies, op. 79; and, in his later, more complex style, the
piano pieces, op. 116, 117, 118 and 119. Songs: Liebestreu,
op. 3, No. 1; Wiegenlied, op. 49, No. 4; the Sapphic Ode,
op. 94, No. 4; Ständchen, op. 106, No. 1; Meine Liebe ist
grün, op. 63, No. 5; O Kühler Wald, op. 72, No. 3. Chamber
works: the two Violin Sonatas, op. 78 and 100, are among
his most genial works; the Quartets, op. 25 and 26; the Trio,
op. 8; the Sextet, op. 18. Of his orchestral works none are
finer than the Second and Third Symphonies, the Violin Concerto,
op. 77, and the Variations on a Theme of Haydn, op. 56a. The
choral works, of which the Song of Destiny is the greatest, are
unhappily seldom given.</small></p>

EPILOGUE: THE MEANING OF MUSIC</p>
<hr class="style2"/>

<p>In the foregoing studies we have been
considering, first, certain fundamental
principles of musical effect in the light
of which alone all special contributions
to music, however various, can
be understood, and second, the particular contributions
of half a dozen of our contemporary
composers, in which we have seen those principles
exemplified. We have assumed, all along,
that music is of undeniable interest to us, that
it has something to say, that it is of sufficient
human value to be worth studying. But now,
before closing, it will be well to examine for a
moment the grounds of that tacit assumption,
to ask ourselves what, after all, is the reason of
our interest in music. Why do we care for it?
What does it mean? To such questions there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
are doubtless many answers. Doubtless different
hearers take different kinds of delight in it,
and its modes of appeal are as various as their
temperaments. Yet music has one sort of appeal
which is deeper than all others, which indeed
acts universally, and which depends on its
extraordinary power to tranquilize the heart, to
instil a peace quite magical and beyond explanation.
It soothes while it excites; and more
wonderful than its ability to stimulate our emotions
is its power to reconcile and harmonize
them. And this it does without the aid of
any intellectual process; it offers us no argument,
it formulates no solacing philosophy;
rather it abolishes thought, to set up in its stead
a novel activity that is felt as immediately, inexplicably
grateful. To suggest how the combination
of sounds can have upon us so profound
an effect will be the object of this final
paper.</p>

<p>Mortal life, as we become acquainted with it
in experience, unshaped by any philosophic or
artistic activity, is complex, confused, and irrational.
From our babyhood, when we put our
fingers in the pretty fire and draw them forth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
cruelly burned, until the moment when a
draught of air or the bursting of a blood-vessel
suddenly arrests our important enterprises in
mid-course, we constantly find our faculties,
both animal and divine, encountering a world
not kindly adjusted. On the material plane
we find drought, frost, and famine, storm, accident,
disease. On the plane of feeling and
sentiment there are the separation of friends,
the death of dear ones, loneliness, doubt, and
disappointment; in the world of the spirit are
sin and sorrow, the weakness and folly of ourselves
and of others, meaningless mischance,
and the caprice of destiny. In such a world,
good fortune must often seem as insulting as
bad, and happiness no better than misery.
Where all is accidental, how can aught be significant?
When our highest interests are defenceless
against the onslaught, not of grave evil but
of mere absurdity, how is it possible to live
with dignity or hope?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, men have, by various means,
fought sturdily against the capriciousness of life
and the despair it engenders. All practical morality,
to begin with, is one form of defence&mdash;comparatively
a low form, but still of use. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
moral man, facing the universe undaunted, asserts
his own power to develop in it at least his
personal particle of righteousness. As much
strength as he has shall be spent on the side of
order. If the world be unjust, he at least will
love justice. If every one else be ruled by
chance, he at least will be ruled by reason. If
wicked men pursue evil, he will pursue good.
From the earliest to the latest times literature
has recorded such resolve. The letters of Stevenson
no less than the journal of Marcus Aurelius
relate the purpose of the brave individual
to graft, to impress&mdash;yes, to inflict&mdash;human
meaning upon an untamed universe. The stoic
faith has always built on the practical power of
the single man; a phrase of Thoreau's might
serve for its motto: «In the midst of this labyrinth
let us live a <em>thread</em> of life.»</p>

<p>The intellect is more ambitious than the
moral sense. Not content with the degree of
unity a man can develop in the seething world
by his single action, philosophy seeks to prove
that the world itself, as a whole, deriving its
nature as it must from mind, is orderly. Constructive
idealism, beginning with the argument
that a subject cannot truly know an object unless both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
are included in a higher mental organism,
deduces from the common facts of consciousness
the real existence of an all-inclusive
Spirit. Furthermore, one of its ablest modern
exponents, Professor Josiah Royce, has worked
out the ethical implications of the doctrine in a
way that concerns us here. He shows that the
apparent irrationality of our world proceeds
from the fragmentariness of our finite view, and
that God, who sees his universe as a whole,
must find it rational; so that «our chaos is his
order, our farce his tragedy, our horror his spirituality.»
Were our span of consciousness
widened until we could perceive the whole of
existence in one thought, we should find the
deep organic beauty that now we yearn for in
vain. Philosophy, then, assures us both of the
fundamental perfection of the world as a whole
and of the inaccessibility of this perfection to
us. Deeply satisfying because so sure and so
ultimate, it tells us nothing of details, it has no
direct word for the sorrows and the perplexities
of our daily lives. It leaves us often longing
for a warmer, nearer assurance of the rightness
of things.</p>

<p>And so, to many, human love first reveals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
the divine unity all are seeking. The lover
reasons little about consciousness; he knows,
directly and overpoweringly, that his one need is
to serve the beloved. This commanding aim
employs all his impulses and appetites, and he
finds in pure disinterested service a peace that
his own warring desires cannot invade. He
comprehends for the first time his own true
identity, he becomes integral and serene. Furthermore,
as his love grows deeper, as it spends
its inexhaustible wealth more widely, learning to
take for object not only the human beloved, but
all virtue and beauty, his spiritual life becomes
daily larger and surer, it unifies an ever complexer
body of thought and deed in its perfect
organism. It acquires an alchemy with which
it can dissolve even the stubborn externalities
of fate; for fate itself cannot take away the
power to serve, and in service love finds its joy.
Renunciation, even, it never enters upon except
to gain a higher good, and that essence in the
soul which makes a sacrifice is one with that
which in happier circumstances would enjoy.
Love thus shares already the nature of religion,
and confers the same benefits. In exacting entire
self-surrender it bequeaths superiority to accident,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
an unassailable serenity. Indeed, religion
is but love expanded and made universal.</p>

<p>Religion, then, man's final means of reading
rationality in the countenance of an irrational
world, is the culmination toward which the other
three naturally tend. It is the natural goal of
love, because he who loves the divine in one
person must soon love it in all. It is the goal
of science and philosophy, because these place
the heart open-eyed upon the threshold of the
radiant reality, where it cannot but worship. It
is the natural outcome of morality, too; for the
moral man, seeing others eager for goodness,
learns that the divine virtue is everywhere.
And religion retains in itself the character of all
these tributary insights. Like morality it prompts
devotion of personal strength to the good cause;
like philosophy, it affords clarity and breadth of
vision; it is animated by the same pure, deep
passion that is at the soul of love. It offers
man a code of conduct, a cosmology, and an
object of devotion. Surely, one would think
he could ask for nothing more.</p>

<p>But, alas! we are not perfect creatures, capable
of living always on these heights. Hours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
of weariness and confusion overtake us, our
glimpses of the shining cosmos fade away, and
we are left groping in a formless world. The
universe does not change, but our faculties become
jaded, we cannot keep them at the necessary
pitch. The moralist knows moods of discouragement,
when his power is at ebb, and the
forces of evil press him sorely, entering even
his own heart in the forms of temptation, sloth,
and despair. The scientist encounters facts
which his schemes cannot embrace, and for the
moment interprets his own limitation as a disorder
in nature. The philosopher often finds
the universe more than a match for his synthetic
powers of thought. Love has its tragedies,
and faith its hours of eclipse. Even
Christ must cry out, «My God! my God!
why hast thou forsaken me?» The world, in
a word, is too big for us. Facing its vast whirl
and glitter with our modest kit of senses, intellect,
and spirit, we are blinded, deafened,
dizzied, completely bewildered. And then, recalling
with wistful regret our partial insights,
we fancy them gone forever and ourselves
wholly lost.</p>

<p>It is just at these moments, when the mind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
momentarily fails in its unequal struggle with
reality, that we discover the deep meaning and
the supreme service of Art. For Art is the
tender human servant that man has made himself
for his solace. He has adjusted it to his
faculties and restrained it within his scope;
fashioning it from the infinite substance, he has
impressed upon it finite form. It is a voice
less thunderous than nature's, a lamp that does
not dazzle like the great sun. It simplifies the
wealth that is too luxuriant, and makes tangible
a fragment of the great ethereal beauty no
mortal can grasp. Thus art is visible and audible
rightness; it is the love of God made
manifest to the senses, a particular symbol of a
universal harmony. When we are too weary
to be comforted by the remote, abstract good
that religion promises, art comes with its immediate,
substantial, caressing beauty. Seeking
to prove nothing, making no appeal to our
logical intellects, requiring of us no activity,
saying nothing of aught beyond itself, it is
supremely restful. Finding us defeated in our
search for rationality, it says, «Search no longer,
puzzle no more; merely listen and look; see,
here it is!» Its beauty answers our problems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
never directly, but by gently making them
irrelevant.</p>

<p>Art, then, differs from morality, philosophy,
love and religion, in that it presents directly to
sense the variety in unity which they manifest only
to the mind and spirit. Like them, it deals with
life, but the unity that it attains by selection
and exclusion is unlike their unity in being
tangible. Made by man, it has this one supreme
advantage, that it is adapted from the
outset to his needs. What it cannot unify it
can exclude. Though nature care nothing for
the peculiarities of the eye, a landscape painter
can omit a tree that upsets the balance of his
composition. Actual men and women present
all sorts of incongruities of figure, but the sculptor
can suppress the stooping shoulders, the
knobby hips, and the bandy legs. Language
bristles with trivial and vulgar words, but no
poet except Walt Whitman thinks it necessary
to write about hatters, who cannot, according to
Stevenson, «be tolerated in emotional verse.»
Out of the infinite number of sounds that besiege
our natural ears, musicians have selected
about ninety definite tones, preordained to congruity,
with which to weave their marvelous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
fabric. That is ever the method of art; it excludes
the irrelevant or the discordant, in order
to secure a salient and pure integrity. By
sacrificing something of the richness of experience,
it gains a rationality unknown in experience.
Browning's Pippa is a gentle, noble soul,
bringing goodness everywhere; in real life she
would be a poor mill-girl insulted by a thousand
sordid and accidental details. Shelley portrays
Beatrice Cenci in the transfiguring light of poetic
truth; actual experience would show her
tortured by a sinister and ignoble fate. No
Greek youth could have matched the perfect
plastic beauty of the Disk-thrower, and no
Italian woman ever symbolized cruel, sphinx-like
loveliness as does the Mona Lisa. Corot's
nature is grayer and softer and more harmonious
than ever existed on earth. And such songs as
Schumann's «Ich Grolle Nicht» and Tschaïkowsky's
«Nur Wer die Sehnsucht Kennt»
pulsate with a passion as intense but far less
torn and fragmentary than that by which they
were inspired. This serene perfection, which
wraps like a mantle all works of genuine art,
results from harmonious organization, and is
attained only by excluding the irrelevancies always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
present in nature. Whistler is wise as
well as witty when he exclaims that «to ask
the painter to copy nature as he sees it is to invite
the pianist to sit on the keyboard.» Were
there, to be sure, a perfect adjustment between
nature and our faculties, were we able to discern
the unity that must exist even in the infinitely
complex Whole of the world, then such a
dictum would be outgrown, and selection would
cease to be the procedure of art. But until we
have grown to possess universal synthetic power
art will have its solacing mission and its selective
method as now.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it will have also, of course, its
inevitable limitations. If it be more orderly
than nature, it will be far less rich and various;
effects that nature presents in a bewildering
drench of experience, a work of art will have to
isolate and develop alone. A pictured landscape,
however perfect, is but one phase of the
reality; in nature there is ceaseless play and
change, mood succeeds mood, and the charm is
more than half in the wayward flux and transformation.
A portrait shows but one character;
a human face is a whole gallery of personalities.
The wealth of experience excites even while it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
bewilders us, and when we turn to the work of art
we unconsciously adopt a narrower standard.
Primitive art especially impresses us as bare and
denuded, because the primitive artist has neither
technical skill nor synthetic power of thought
to combine more than a few elements. Thus
early painting and sculpture, in dealing with the
human figure, carry delineation little further
than to show man with head and body, two
legs and two arms. Refinements of contour
and proportion are left to be observed by later
artists. Similarly the folk ballads in which
poetry takes its origin confine themselves to
elementary incidents and emotions. In general,
rudimentary art is always so far behind nature as
to seem to have hardly any connection with it
at all.</p>

<p>As time goes on, however, art passes through
an evolution, becoming gradually more potent
in its treatment of reality. Its progress takes
the form of a curious zigzag, the resultant
of two alternating tendencies; what happens
is something like this. For a while it
develops its power of synthesis (a power dependent
both upon technical skill in handling
material and on organizing force of thought)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
until it is able to present a few simple factors of
effect in clear, salient unity. This is what is
called a period of classicism. Then, dissatisfied
with its attainment, desiring a richer reflection
of the great whirl of experience, it reaches out
after novel effects; its vision is for a while more
extended than clear, and, presenting many
effects which it cannot yet unify, it becomes
brilliant, suggestive, fragmentary, turgid, inchoate.
There has been a sacrifice of the old
simple clarity for a richer chaos, or, in the trite
terminology, a romantic movement. Now,
however, technical skill and synthetic power of
thought again advance, and a new and complexer
order supervenes on the temporary confusion.
Unity of effect is regained, art is classic
once more (but with increased wealth of meaning),
and the time is ripe for another burst of
romanticism. By this alternation of impulses
art grows, and when either tendency is defective
we have a diseased art. If there be no romantic
movement, if art remains contented with its
acquired scope, there is stagnation, pedantry,
academicism; if there be no classical period of
assimilation, we have vagueness and turgidity,
qualities even more fatal, since, as we have seen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
the justification of art is its power to clarify.
The general formula for wholesome artistic advance
might, then, run thus: «Increase in the
variety of the selected elements, without loss of
the ideal unity imposed upon them.» And the
ideal goal of art is a representation of the whole
of life, stamped with complete unity.</p>

<p>Turning now to music, we must point out
that, although it has in a general way undergone
a development like that of the other arts,
made up of alternating classic and romantic
movements, it has had from the first certain advantages
over them in the struggle for richness
and clarity, advantages proceeding from its fundamental
nature. For tones are unique in our
mental experience as being at once more directly
expressive of the emotional essence of life than
any other art-material, and more susceptible of
orderly structure.</p>

<p>That music is beyond all the other arts directly
expressive of man's deeper passional life scarcely
needs theoretic proof; the fact is in the experience
of every one who has listened to a military
band, to a homely song lovingly rendered,
or to a ragged Hungarian with a violin. These
things take a physical grip upon our emotions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
they stir our diaphragms, galvanize our spines,
and compel us to shiver, laugh or weep. Combined
with such physical affections, moreover,
are ideas of indescribable vividness and poignancy.
Joy and grief, hope and despair, serenity,
aspiration, and horror, fill our hearts as
we listen to music. They come in their pure
essence&mdash;not as qualities of something else.
And this is what is meant by the familiar statement
that the other arts are representative while
music is presentative. Poetry, painting, and
sculpture show us things outside ourselves, joyful
or grievous things perhaps, hopeful or desperate
or beautiful or ugly things, but still
<em>things</em>. But music shows us nothing but the
qualities, the disembodied feelings, the passional
essences. Let the reader recall for a moment the
effects of painting or of poetry, the way in which
they present emotion. Is it not always by symbolism,
by indirection? Does not the feeling
merely exhale from the object instead of constituting
the object as it does in music? In
looking at a pastoral landscape, for instance, do
we not first think of the peaceful scene represented,
and only secondarily feel serenity itself?
In reading «La Belle Dame sans Merci» is it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
not only by a process of associative thought
that we come to shudder with a sense of unearthly
and destructive passion? Yes, in the
representative arts emotion is merely adjective;
in music alone is it substantive. We see in a
portrait a lovely woman; we behold in marble
a noble youth; we read in poetry a desperate
story; in music, on the contrary, we hear love,
nobility, despair. And since this emotional life
is the deepest reality we know, since our intuitions
constitute in fact the very essence of that
world-spirit which is but projected and symbolized
in sky, sun, ocean, stars, and earth, music
cannot but be a richer record of our ultimate
life than those arts which deal with objects and
symbols alone. It is the penetration, the ultimacy,
of music that gives it such extraordinary
power. The other arts excel it in definiteness,
in concreteness, in the ability to delineate
a scene or tell a story; but music surpasses
them all in power to present the naked and basic
facts of existence, the essential, informing passions.</p>

<p>A secondary and subordinate advantage of
music proceeds from the nature of its material.
Tones, produced and controlled by man, are far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
more easily stamped with the unity he desires
than the objects of external nature. These are
stubborn outer facts, created without regard to
the æsthetic sense, and in a thousand ways unamenable
to it. The great dazzle of sunlight is
too keen for human eyes, which perceive better
on dim, gray days; many of nature's contours
are larger than we can grasp. Every painter will
tell you that there are inharmonious colors in
the sunset, and one daring critic has gone so far
as to impugn the «vulgarity of outline» of the
American hills. It matters not whether the
maladjustment indicate a fault in nature or a
limitation in man; the point to note is that the
representative arts deal with a material less pliable
than tones. Words, the material of poetry,
occupy in this respect a curious intermediate
position. Like tones, they are man-made, but,
like outer objects, they are «given,» fixed and
indocile to man's æsthetic needs. (We remember
the example of the «hatter.») Though
made by man, in fact, they are made not by his
æsthetic but by his practical energy. They
were devised, not for beautiful adjustment, but
to convey thoughts, and when the poet comes
and uses them to make an art he finds them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
almost as perverse as the painter's trees and
hills. Tones, however, have no practical utility
whatever; not only do they not exist outside
of music, but they would be of no use if
they did. Hence they may be chosen and
grouped by the free æsthetic sense alone, acting
without let or hindrance, except what is imposed
by the thing to be expressed. For hundreds of
years man has been testing and comparing, accepting
and rejecting, the elements of the tonal
series, with the result that we have to-day the
ladder or scale of ninety-odd definitely fixed
tones, out of which all music is composed.
And though the series has been developed
wholly by instinct, and it is only within the last
half-century that the natural laws underlying it
have been discovered, yet it has been built up
so slowly and tentatively, and with so sure and
delicate a sense of its internal structure, that it
is an unsurpassable basis for complex and yet
perfectly harmonious tone-combinations. In a
word, the material of music is by origin self-congruous,
fitted to clear structure, preordained
to an order at once rich and transparent.</p>

<p>Preordained to beauty, then, is the musician's
material: and yet the musician is not exempted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
from the difficulties of his brother artists. If
they work in a less plastic material, he has to
govern subtler and more wayward forces. He
can attain a wonderful perfection, but only
through unremitting labor. His task is to embody
the turbulent, irrational human feelings in
serene and beautiful forms. He is to master
the dominating, to reconcile the warring, to impose
unity on the diverse and the repellant.
Mozart and Haydn might handle their art with
ready ease, because their emotions were naïve;
but Beethoven, who essayed to look into the
stormy and tortured heart of man, found himself
involved in a travail Titanic and interminable.
Nevertheless he did succeed in harnessing
the vast forces with which he deals, and his
success is as conclusive a vindication as we
could desire of music's power to deal with its
profound verities. When we think of Beethoven's
immortal works, immortal both by
their strength and by their beauty, can we
doubt that music expresses our deepest emotional
nature with unrivalled fullness, and yet
so reconciles it with itself as to symbolize our
highest spiritual peace?</p>

<p>From the swelter and jungle of experience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
in which it is our lot to pass our mortal days,
days which philosophy cannot make wholly
rational, nor love wholly capable of service, nor
religion wholly serene, we are thus privileged
to emerge, from time to time, into fairer realms.
Tantalized with an unattainable vision of order,
we turn to art, and especially to music, for
assurance that our hope is not wholly chimerical.
Then</p>

<p class="indent15">«Music pours on mortals<br />
Its beautiful disdain.»</p>

<p>Disdainful it is, truly, because it reminds us
of the discord and the rhythmless onmarch of
our days. It voices the passions that have torn
and mutilated and stung and blinded us; we
meditate the foolishness, the fatality, of our
chaotic lives. But beautiful it is also; and it has
been wisely said that beauty offers us «a pledge
of the possible conformity of the soul with nature.»
Music, at once disdainful and beautiful,
shows us our deepest feelings, so wayward and
tragic in experience, merged into ineffable perfection.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
